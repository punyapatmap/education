## Planetary Mindset

-   What is a **planetary mindset**?

. . .

**Plantary Mindset**

:   A mindset that recognizes global interdependence, environmental limits, and health equity as medical imperatives

[**Why this matters for medical education today?**]{.fragment .fade-in}

## The World Has Changed

> *We are not just training doctors for patients, but for the planet.*

::: incremental
-   Climate crisis and health\
-   Pandemics and global collaboration\
-   Migration, inequality, and planetary health\
-   AI, big data, and digital frontiers
:::

## What is Planetary Health?

-   Defined by **The Lancet Commission (2015)**\
-   Health of human civilization and the natural systems it depends on\
-   Implications for clinical practice and health systems

## Why Planetary Mindset in Medical Education?

::: incremental
-   Integrating **sustainability**, **social justice**, and **systems thinking**\
-   Training **future-ready** doctors\
-   Building **resilience and empathy** in a complex world

## 5 Pillars of a Planetary Mindset

::: incremental
1.  Systems Thinking\
2.  Ecological Literacy\
3.  Cultural Humility\
4.  Ethical Global Citizenship\
5.  Action-Oriented Leadership

## Beyond Outcome-based Education or Competency-based Education

### Global Examples of Curricula

-   Planetary health tracks (e.g., Harvard, Edinburgh)\
-   Electives on climate and health\
-   Interdisciplinary models (e.g., One Health)\
-   Student-led eco-health projects

## What Should We Teach?

-   Climate-health links\
-   Resource stewardship (e.g., low-carbon clinical practice)\
-   Social determinants & planetary boundaries\
-   Crisis medicine in the Anthropocene\
-   Health policy & advocacy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What should we start teaching?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Should We Teach?

-   Experiential learning: case-based, problem-based, service learning\
-   Interprofessional and transdisciplinary approaches\
-   Decision making on unnessessary treatment decision
-   Digital simulations (e.g., climate crisis scenarios)\
-   Innovation challenges and student initiatives

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Needs to Change?

-   Move beyond the biomedical model\
-   Faculty development for planetary teaching\
-   New frameworks for assessment\
-   Institutional commitment: net-zero hospitals, green campuses

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

### How Should We Teach the Next Generation of Medical Students?

-   What skills and values are essential in the next [10–20]{.fragment .strike} years?
-   [What topics are missing from your current curriculum?]{.fragment .blur .fade-in}
-   [How can your institution foster a planetary mindset?]{.fragment .blur .fade-in}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

-   Tomorrow's doctors must care for people *and* the planet\
-   Medical education must evolve for **interconnected**, **uncertain**, and **global** futures\
-   A planetary mindset is not optional — it is essential
