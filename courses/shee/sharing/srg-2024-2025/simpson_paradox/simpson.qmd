## Why?! That doesn't make sense

> "When the trend reverses upon considering a hidden variable."

## Objectives

-   **Beware of confounding factors**
-   **Beware of how you conclude the data**

## What is Simpson's Paradox?

::: incremental

Simpson's Paradox
: A phenomenon in which a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.
: Indicates the presence of hidden variables.

:::

#
## Example 1: Cambridge Admissions (1996)

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Admission Summary

| Gender | Admitted/Total N | Admit Rate Overall |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Male   | 584/2,470        | 24%                |
| Female | 274/1,184        | 23%                |

### Subgroup Analysis

|   | Women |   |   | Men |   |   |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|  | **Applied** | **Accepted** | **%** | **Applied** | **Accepted** | **%** |
| Computer Science | 26 | 7 | 27% | 228 | 58 | 25% |
| Economics | 240 | 63 | 26% | 512 | 112 | 22% |
| Engineering | 164 | 52 | 32% | 972 | 252 | 26% |
| Medicine | 416 | 99 | 24% | 578 | 140 | 24% |
| Veterinary Medicine | 338 | 53 | 16% | 180 | 22 | 12% |
| **TOTAL** | 1,184 | 274 | **23%** | 2,470 | 584 | 24% |

## How would you conclude from this data?

**Observation:** 

A. Males seem to have higher admission rates than females.

B. Overall, men had a higher acceptance rate.

C. Within each subject, women actually had a higher acceptance rate.

# Theory Behind

::: incremental
-   **Confounding Variables:** Variables that influence both the independent and dependent variable, creating a spurious association.
-   **Aggregation Bias:** Misleading results when data is improperly combined across groups.
:::

## Cambridge Admissions: Simpson's Paradox

**Subgroup View:**

-   In every department:
    -   **Women's acceptance rates** are **higher** than men's.
-   But **overall**:
    -   Men have a slightly **higher** acceptance rate.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Key Confounder:** - Women applied more to **competitive departments**.
:::

## Cambridge Admissions (Fix)

::: incremental

**Solution:** - Compare acceptance **within each department**. - Adjust for department competitiveness (confounder).

**Takeaway:** Always check subgroup data before concluding bias.

# Example 2: {.smaller .scrollable}
## Smoking Mothers and Small Babies 

**Aggregated Data:**

| Group               | \% Small for Age |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Smoking mothers     | 15%              |
| Non-smoking mothers | 10%              |

**Observation:** [- Babies born to smoking mothers are less likely to be small for gestational age (SGA).]{.fragment}

**Reality:** [- Smoking mothers tend to deliver preterm, affecting size distributions.]{.fragment}


# Example 2: {.smaller .scrollable}
## Smoking Mothers: Subgroup Data (SGA Mortality)

**SGA Infant Mortality Rates:**

| Group                            | SGA Mortality Rate |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Smoking Mothers' SGA Infants     | 3%                 |
| Non-Smoking Mothers' SGA Infants | 6%                 |

. . .

**Conclusion:** - Among SGA infants, **those born to smoking mothers had lower mortality rates**.

# Example 2: {.smaller .scrollable}
## Smoking Mothers (Fix)

**Solution:** - Adjust for **gestational age**. - Compare SGA infants **within smoking status**.

**Takeaway:** Always stratify on major medical variables.


# Example 3: {.smaller .scrollable}
## Treatment Effectiveness

**Aggregated Data:**

| Group       | Recovery Rate Overall | Severity |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Treatment A | 80%                   | Mild     |
| Treatment B | 60%                   | Severe   |

**Observation:** [- Treatment A seems better than Treatment B overall.]{.fragment}

**Reality:** [- Patients given Treatment A were healthier at baseline.]{.fragment}

# Example 3: {.smaller .scrollable}
## Treatment Effectiveness Subgroup

**Subgroup Recovery Rates:**

| Severity | Treatment A | Treatment B |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Mild     | 82%         | 83%         |
| Severe   | 58%         | 60%         |

. . .

**Conclusion:** - **Within severity groups**, Treatment B performed slightly better.

# Example 3: Treatment Effectiveness (Fix)

**Solution:** - Compare recovery rates **within severity levels**.

**Takeaway:** Always account for baseline characteristics.


# Common Pitfalls

-   Relying on **aggregate data** without checking subgroups.
-   Ignoring **confounders** or assuming none exist.
-   Jumping to **causal conclusions** from observational data.


# How to Avoid Simpson's Paradox

-   **Stratify** data when appropriate.
-   **Adjust** for confounders statistically (e.g., regression models).
-   **Interpret carefully** and always seek hidden variables.

# Final Thoughts

-   Always ask: *Could there be a hidden variable?*\
-   Simpson's paradox reminds us that data analysis requires **caution** and **curiosity**.
