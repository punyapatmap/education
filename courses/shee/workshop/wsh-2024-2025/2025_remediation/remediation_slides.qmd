# Overview and Framing of Remediation

## When and what to remediate?

![Remediation takes place in a zone between regular practice and failure. Adapted from Ellaway et al. 2017 and Kalet et al. 2017](images/Screenshot%202025-06-10%20at%2010.45.27.png){#fig-remediation-zone}

## Area to focus in remediation

# Learning Disabilities vs. Learning Differences

## What are Learning Disability?

-   Reading disorder (dyslexia)
-   Mathematics disorder (dyscalculia)
-   Disorder of written expression (dysgraphia)
-   Language disorders (receptive and/or expressive)
-   Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
-   Executive function deficit
-   Autism spectrum disorder/nonverbal learning disorder

# Phases in Remediation

## Phases in Remediation

::: incremental
1.  Setting Up the Institution’s Remediation Process
2.  Structural Elements of the Remediation Process
3.  Supporting the Ultimate Decision

## 

### 1st Phase - Setting Up the Institution’s Remediation Process

::: incremental
1.  ***Goal 1A***: Uphold the Professional Standard, While Maintaining Empathy for Individual Learners’ Struggles

2.  ***Goal 1B***: Ensure That Admissions and Selection Processes Correspond with Desired Outcomes - Diversity!

3.  ***Goal 1C***: Transparently Align Instructional Paradigms with Defined Outcomes

4.  ***Goal 1D***: Cultivate Effective Support Systems - Mentoring and a Culture of Feedback

### 2nd Phase - Structural Elements of the Remediation Process

# Diversity, Inclusion, and Remediation (DIR)

## Strategy Examples

### Counterstereotypic imaging {.scrollable}

::: incremental

-   **Visualizing positive exemplars of minoritized groups**
    -   abstract (e.g., photos or symbols)
    -   well-known
    -   direct (from people you know)
-   **Individuation**
    -   Spending one-on-one time meeting with individuals about whose identities you have biases or who have different life experiences, rather than making generalized assumptions about them as part of their minoritized group 
- **Perspective taking**\
    -   Finding respectful ways to inhabit viewpoints of people in marginalized groups (e.g., watching a documentary or reading a thought piece)
-   **Values affirmation**
    -   Reinforcing values of equity, both as a mental subroutine and explicitly to learners
    -   Framing every encounter with a URHP learner as a commitment to equity and fairness reinforces those values

## The Learning Curve

![Prototypical Learning Curve. A prototypical learning curve demonstrating how learning effort is related to learning outcomes.](images/Screenshot%202025-06-10%20at%2011.29.36.png){#fig-learning-curve}

## Potential difficulties for each phase of the learning curve {.scrollable}

1.  **Latent phase**

    1.  Inefficient orientation to the learning task

    2.  Suboptimal resources identified

    3.  Lack of meta-cognition

    4.  Inability to structure learning in terms of time or conditions

2.  **Early rapid learning**

    1.  Intoxication by superficial approaches to learning

    2.  Learning overly oriented to routinization

    3.  Overconfidence (DunningKruger effect)
    
3. **Inflection pointlearning slows and Asymptotic learning**

    1.  Misinterpretation of slowing as achieving competency or mastery
    
    2.  Fatalism as to the conditions of learning
