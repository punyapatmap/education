Many academic medical centers, major universities, and specialty societies now sponsor physician leadership training programs. To meet this need, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, as part of its Primary Care-Population Medicine (PC-PM) Program, designed a four-year integrated curriculum, Leadership in Health Care, to engage with leadership topics starting early in the preclinical stages of training. This paper describes the design and implementation of this leadership curriculum for PC-PM students.},

  abstract = {Background Although entrustment-supervision ratings are more intuitive compared to other rating scales, it is not known whether their use accurately assesses the appropriateness of care provided by a resident. Objective To determine the frequency of incorrect entrustment ratings assigned by faculty and whether accuracy of an entrustment-supervision scale differed by resident performance when the scripted resident performance level is known. Methods Faculty participants rated standardized residents in 10 videos using a 4-point entrustment-supervision scale. We calculated the frequency of rating a resident incorrectly. We performed generalizability (G) and decision (D) studies for all 10 cases (768 ratings) and repeated the analysis using only cases with an entrustment score of 2. Results The mean score by 77 raters for all videos was 2.87 (SD=0.86) with a mean of 2.37 (SD=0.72), 3.11 (SD=0.67) and 3.78 (SD=0.43) for the scripted levels of 2, 3, and 4. Faculty ratings differed from the scripted score for 331of 768 (43\%) ratings. Most errors were ratings higher than the scripted score (223, 67\%). G studies estimated the variance proportions of rater and case to be 4.99\% and 54.29\%. D studies estimated that 3 raters would need to watch 10 cases. The variance proportion of rater was 8.5\% when the analysis was restricted to level 2 entrustment, requiring 15 raters to watch 5 cases. Conclusions Participants underestimated residents’ potential need for greater supervision. Overall agreement between raters and scripted scores were low.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative case study was to understand how faculty experience the transition from Blackboard to Canvas LMS and which LMS is preferred. The general problem addressed in this study was that California Community College students’ success and retention in online courses was 7-10\% lower than in face-to-face courses. To try to increase success and retention the CCC Chancellor’s office chose the Canvas learning management system as the common course management system for the state. The specific problem addressed in this study was that it was not known how faculty experience the Canvas LMS and whether they prefer it to Blackboard. It was also unknown how faculty experience the transition from Blackboard to Canvas. The setting of this study was a CCC in southern California who conducted a Blackboard-to-Canvas transition program. This study used three data collection methods: face-to-face interviews, a focus group, and a review of existing documentation. The central question of this study was whether faculty from a California community college prefer Blackboard or Canvas and if so, why? Five themes emerged from the findings, four of the themes directly relate to the study questions. (a) Faculty prefer Canvas LMS, (b) Technology acceptance is important to LMS preference, (c) The LMS is important for designing successful online learning experiences, (d) Changing LMSs is hard, and (e) faculty need professional development focused on understanding course organization using modules and how to communicate with students.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Non-teaching services (NTS) are becoming increasingly prevalent in academic hospitals. This study was designed to determine if the presence of an NTS is associated with higher acuity and altered case mix on the teaching service. Method: The authors carried out a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of data about all general medical admissions between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2005 to either of two teaching hospitals in Rochester, New York. A total of 6,907 inpatients were studied, of whom 1,976 (29\%) were admitted to medicine resident services and 4,931 (71\%) were admitted to an NTS. Hospital billing databases were used to determine patient demographics, ICD-9 diagnoses, Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, and patient disposition. Results: Compared with NTS patients, patients on resident services had higher median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (3.0 vs. 2.0, P {$<$} .001), numbers of comorbidities (9.0 vs. 8.0, P {$<$}.001), and were more likely to require intensive care (15.5\% vs. 7.6\%, P {$<$} .001) and to die in the hospital (8.2\% vs. 4.5\%, P {$<$} .001). Patients on the resident services were more likely to have acute renal failure, respiratory failure, septicemia, and HIV. Residents were less likely to care for patients with primary diagnoses of chest pain, cellulitis, alcohol withdrawal, and sickle cell crisis. The differences in patients’ conditions between resident and non-teaching services were similar in the two hospitals and also among patients who had not received intensive care. A key limitation of this study is that one of the hospitals temporarily closed for three months during the study. Conclusions: Patients on resident services may be more medically complex and more likely to have high-acuity diagnoses than patients on NTS. How these differences affect residents’ education, residents’ career decisions, and practice styles deserves further study.},

  author = {Kesselheim, Jennifer C and Najita, Julie and Morley, Debra and Bair, Elizabeth and Joffe, Steven},
  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the relationship between recently trained paediatricians’ ethics knowledge and exposure to a formal ethics or professionalism curriculum during residency. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of recently trained paediatricians which included a validated 23-item instrument called the Test of Residents’ Ethics Knowledge for Pediatrics. The sample included paediatricians who completed medical school in 2006–2008, whose primary specialty was paediatrics or a paediatric subspecialty, and who completed paediatric residency training in 2010–2011. This sample was stratified based on residency programme variables: presence of a formal curriculum in ethics or professionalism, programme size and American Board of Pediatrics certifying exam passage rate. Paediatricians were randomly selected from each stratum for survey participation. Results Among the 370 responding paediatricians (55\%), the mean knowledge score was 17.3 (SD 2.2) out of a possible 23. Presence of a formal curriculum in ethics and/or professionalism was not significantly associated with knowledge. Knowledge was lowest on items about parental requests for a child to undergo genetic testing (2 items, 44\% and 85\% incorrect), preserving patient confidentiality over email (55\% incorrect), decision-making regarding life-sustaining technologies (61\% incorrect), and decision-making principles such as assent and parental permission (2 items, 47\% and 49\% incorrect). Conclusions This study highlights several areas in which paediatricians’ knowledge may be low and that are amenable to targeted educational interventions. These findings should prompt discussion and research among ethicists and educators about how ethics and professionalism curricula can more consistently influence paediatricians’ knowledge.},

Despite the prevalent use of learning analytics in this regard, little attention has been paid to systematically surveying and summarising relevant latest work. To address the literature gap, this paper reviews the use of learning analytics to support prediction of at-risk students. The study covers 138 research articles published between 2013 and 2022 which were collected from the Scopus database. Through a content analysis approach, the relevant work was examined in terms of the prediction objectives, the types of data collected, the techniques used for prediction, and the metrics employed for evaluation of prediction performance. The findings reveal a strong scholarly interest in the prediction of students’ learning performance to identify those who are potentially at risk. The common types of data collected are related to students’ previous academic performance, socio-demographics, and learning behaviours, particularly those on learning management systems. The most frequently used techniques for prediction are decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian networks. The results also show the widespread use of classification accuracy, recall, sensitivity, and true positive rate as the performance metrics. The findings contribute to advancing our understanding about the potential of learning analytics for at-risk student prediction, as well as informing the provision of timely and proper support for specific student groups.},

This study applied learning analytics and educational big data approaches for the early prediction of students’ final academic performance in a blended Calculus course. Real data with 21 variables were collected from the proposed course, consisting of video-viewing behaviors, out-of-class practice behaviors, homework and quiz scores, and after-school tutoring. This study applied principal component regression to predict students’ final academic performance. The experimental results show that students’ final academic performance could be predicted when only one-third of the semester had elapsed. In addition, we identified seven critical factors that affect students’ academic performance, consisting of four online factors and three traditional factors. The results showed that the blended data set combining online and traditional critical factors had the highest predictive performance.},

When conducting an EFA, researchers must choose the number of factors to retain – a critical decision that has drastic effects if made incorrectly. In this article, we examine a newly proposed method of choosing the number of factors to retain. In the new method, confidence intervals are created around each eigenvalue and factors are retained if the entire eigenvalue is greater than 1.0. Results show that this new method outperforms the traditional Guttman rule, but does not surpass the accuracy of Velicer’s minimum average partial (MAP) or Horn’s parallel analysis (PA). MAP was the most accurate method overall, although it had a tendency to underfactor in some conditions. PA was the second most accurate method, although it frequently overfactored. PA was also found to be sensitive to sample size and MAP was found to occasionally grossly overfactor; these findings had not previously been reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Precision education is now recognized as a new challenge of applying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and learning analytics to improve both learning performance and teaching quality. To promote precision education, digital learning platforms have been widely used to collect educational records of students’ behavior, performance, and other types of interaction. On the other hand, the increasing volume of students’ learning behavioral data in virtual learning environments provides opportunities for mining data on these students’ learning patterns. Accordingly, identifying students’ online learning patterns on various digital learning platforms has drawn the interest of the learning analytics and educational data mining research communities. In this study, the authors applied data analytics methods to examine the learning patterns of students using an ebook system for one semester in an undergraduate course. The authors used a clustering approach to identify subgroups of students with different learning patterns. Several subgroups were identified, and the students’ learning patterns in each subgroup were determined accordingly. In addition, the association between these students’ learning patterns and their learning outcomes from the course was investigated. The findings of this study provide educators opportunities to predict students’ learning outcomes by analyzing their online learning behaviors and providing timely intervention for improving their learning experience, which achieves one of the goals of learning analytics as part of precision education.},

A model of perceived locus of causality (PLOC) is developed, using children's self-reported reasons for acting. In Project 1, external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic types of reasons for achievement-related behaviors are shown to conform to a simplex-like (ordered correlation) structure in four samples. These reason categories are then related to existing measures of PLOC and to motivation. A second project examines 3 reason categories (external, introject, and identification) within the domain of prosocial behavior. Relations with measures of empathy, moral judgment, and positive interpersonal relatedness are presented. Finally, the proposed model and conceptualization of PLOC are discussed with regard to intrapersonal versus interpersonal perception, internalization, cause-reason distinctions, and the significance of perceived autonomy in human behavior.},

This article argues further that a "constructivist" research paradigm not only has the potential to resolve some of the tensions between research and practice in health promotion but also is inclusive of knowledge generated by the conventional paradigm. The usefulness of a constructivist paradigm is demonstrated through the use of four practice-based case examples drawn from actual community-based health promotion efforts. The congruence of a constructivist paradigm with the health promotion principles of empowerment and community participation are discussed. Finally, this article argues for the acceptance of the legitimacy of knowledge generated from the constructivist paradigm and concludes that this paradigm is more suited to the goals of current health promotion.},

This paper presents a number of topics in cognitive psychology, summarizes the findings in the field, and explores the implications for teaching and learning. The organization of long-term memory. The acquisition of expertise in an area can be characterized by the development of idiosyncratic memory structures called semantic networks, which are meaningful sets of connections among abstract concepts and/or specific experiences.

Thus, when teaching, new information must be embedded meaningfully in relevant, previously existing knowledge to ensure that it will be retrievable when necessary. Influences on storage and retrieval from memory. A wide variety of variables affect the capacity to store and retrieve information from memory, including meaning, the context and manner in which information is learned, and relevant practice in retrieval. Educational strategies must, therefore, be directed at three goals-to enhance meaning, to reduce dependence on context, and to provide repeated relevant practice in retrieving information.

Experts clearly do not use classic formal decision theory, but rather make use of heuristics, or shortcuts, when making decisions. Nonetheless, experts generally make appropriate decisions.

Twelve lear ning outcomes are speci® ed, and these are further subdivided.The different outcomes have been de® ned at an appropriate level of generality to allow adaptability to the phases of the curriculum, to the subjectmatter, to the instructional methodology and to the students’ learning needs. Outcomes in each of the three areas have distinct underlying characteristics.They move from technical com petences or intelligences to meta-competences including academic, emotional, analytical, creative and personal intelligences. The Dundee outcome model offers an intuitive, user-friendly and transparent approach to com municating learning outcomes. It encourages a holistic and integrated approach to medical education and helps to avoid tension between vocational and academic perspectives.Th e framework can be easily adapted to local needs. It emphasizes the relevance and validity of outcomes to medical practice.The model is relevant to all phases of education and can facilitate the continuum between the different phases. It has the potential of facilitating a com parison between different training prog ramm es in medicine and between different professions engaged in health care deliver y.},

  abstract = {The growth in qualitative research is a well-noted and welcomed fact within the social sciences; however, there is a regrettable lack of tools available for the analysis of qualitative material. There is a need for greater disclosure in qualitative analysis, and for more sophisticated tools to facilitate such analyses. This article details a technique for conducting thematic analysis of qualitative material, presenting a step-by-step guide of the analytic process, with the aid of an empirical example. The analytic method presented employs established, well-known techniques; the article proposes that thematic analyses can be usefully aided by and presented as thematic networks. Thematic networks are web-like illustrations that summarize the main themes constituting a piece of text. The thematic networks technique is a robust and highly sensitive tool for the systematization and presentation of qualitative analyses.},

This article examines two questions concerning teacherbehaviours that are characterised in Self-Determination Theory (Ryan \& Deci, 2000) as autonomy-supportive or suppressive: (1) Can children differentiate among various types of autonomy-enhancing and suppressing teacher behaviours? (2) Which of those types of behaviour are particularly important in predicting feelings toward and engagement in schoolwork? It was hypothesised that teacher behaviours that help students to understand the relevance of schoolwork for their personal interests and goals are particularly important predictors of engagement in schoolwork. Samples and methods. Israeli students in grades 3–5 (N = 498) and in grades 6–8 (N = 364) completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. Results. Smallest Space Analyses indicated that both children and early adolescents can differentiate among three types of autonomy enhancing teacher behaviours –fostering relevance, allowing criticism, and providing choice – and three types of autonomy suppressing teacher behaviours – suppressing criticism, intruding, and forcing unmeaningful acts. Regression analyses supported the hypothesis concerning the importance of teacher behaviours that clarify the personal relevance of schoolwork. Among the autonomy-suppressing behaviours, ‘Criticism-suppression’ was the best predictor of feelings and engagement. Conclusions. The findings underscore the active and empathic nature of teachers’ role in supporting students’ autonomy, and suggest that autonomy-support is important not only for early adolescents but also for children. Discussion of potential determinants of the relative importance of various autonomy-affecting teacher actions suggests that provision of choice should not always be viewed as a major indicator of autonomy support.},

  abstract = {Context All assessments in medical education require evidence of validity to be interpreted meaningfully. In contemporary usage, all validity is construct validity, which requires multiple sources of evidence; construct validity is the whole of validity, but has multiple facets. Five sources – content, response process, internal structure, relationship to other variables and consequences – are noted by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing as fruitful areas to seek validity evidence. Purpose The purpose of this article is to discuss construct validity in the context of medical education and to summarize, through example, some typical sources of validity evidence for a written and a performance examination. Summary Assessments are not valid or invalid; rather, the scores or outcomes of assessments have more or less evidence to support (or refute) a specific interpretation (such as passing or failing a course). Validity is approached as hypothesis and uses theory, logic and the scientific method to collect and assemble data to support or fail to support the proposed score interpretations, at a given point in time. Data and logic are assembled into arguments – pro and con – for some specific interpretation of assessment data. Examples of types of validity evidence, data and information from each source are discussed in the context of a high-stakes written and performance examination in medical education. Conclusion All assessments require evidence of the reasonableness of the proposed interpretation, as test data in education have little or no intrinsic meaning. The constructs purported to be measured by our assessments are important to students, faculty, administrators, patients and society and require solid scientific evidence of their meaning.},

  abstract = {Two important features of contemporary medical education are recognized. The first is an emphasis on assessment as a tool to ensure quality in training programmes, to motivate students and to direct what they learn. The second is a move to outcome-based education where the learning outcomes are defined and decisions about the curriculum are based on these. These two trends are closely related. If teachers are to do a better job of assessing their students, they need an understanding of the assessment process, an appreciation of the learning outcomes to be assessed and a recognition of the most appropriate tools to assess each outcome. Assessment tools selected should be valid, reliable, practical and have an appropriate impact on student learning. The preferred assessment tool will vary with the outcome to be assessed. It is likely to be some form of written test, a performance test such as an OSCE in which the student's competence can be tested in a simulated situation, and a test of the student's behaviour over time in clinical practice, based on tutors' reports and students' portfolios. An assessment profile can be produced for each student which highlights the learning outcomes the student has achieved at the required standard and other outcomes where this is not the case. For educational as well as economic reasons, there should be collaboration across the continuum of education in test development as it relates to the assessment of learning outcomes and in the implementation of a competence-based approach to assessment.},

Issues to be addressed relate to organization matters and to the quality of the assessment. This paper focuses particularly on the latter with respect to ways of ensuring content validity and achieving acceptable levels of reliability. A particular concern has been the demonstrable need for long examinations if high levels of reliability are to be achieved. Strategies for reducing the practical difficulties this raises are discussed. Standard setting methods for use with OSCEs are described.},

In this article, we discuss the constraints and opportunities of our transcription decisions and point to an intermediate, reflective step. We suggest that researchers incorporate reflection into their research design by interrogating their transcription decisions and the possible impact these decisions may have on participants and research outcomes.},

The present multiwave study examines dispositional goal orientation constructs through both two and three-factor models using repeated-measure confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicate dispositional performance goal orientation of the two-factor model can be better partitioned into the Prove and Avoid factors of the three-factor model. Further evidence is presented indicating the potential for more than three factors by further partitioning the Avoid factor into two separate constructs. Consistent with both branches of goal orientation research, learning goal orientation is largely independent of Performance, Prove, and Avoid factors in all tested models.},

Such issues include deciding on the priority or weight given to the quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis in the study, the sequence of the data collection and analysis, and the stage/stages in the research process at which the quantitative and qualitative data are connected and the results are integrated. The article provides a methodological overview of priority, implementation, and mixing in the sequential explanatory design and offers some practical guidance in addressing those issues. It also outlines the steps for graphically representing the procedures in a mixed-methods study. A mixed-methods sequential explanatory study of doctoral students’ persistence in a distance-learning program in educational leadership is used to illustrate the methodological discussion.},

  abstract = {Taking a memory test not only assesses what one knows, but also enhances later retention, a phenomenon known as the testing effect. We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students’ confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. Ó 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The concept of affordance has different interpretations in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, its treatment has been merely as a one-to-one relationship between a user and a technology. We believe that a broader view of affordances is needed which encompasses social and cultural aspects of our everyday life. We propose an interaction-centered view of affordance that can be useful for developing better understandings of designed artefacts. An interactioncentered view of affordance suggests that affordance is an interpretative relationship between users and the technology that emerges during the users’ interaction with the technology in the lived environments. We distinguish two broad classes of affordances: affordance in Information and affordance in Articulation. Affordance in information refers to users’ understanding of a technology based on their semantic and syntactic interpretation; and affordance in articulation refers to users’ interpretations about the use of the technology. We also argue that the notion of affordance should be treated at two levels: at the ‘artefact level’ and at the ‘practice level’. Consequently, we provide two examples to demonstrate our arguments.},

Basic elements of the technology are discussed. These systems have been used in a variety of fields and at all levels of education. Typical goals of ARS questions are discussed, as well as methods of compensating for the reduction in lecture time that typically results from their use. Examples of ARS use occur throughout the literature and often detail positive attitudes from both students and instructors, although exceptions do exist. When used in classes, ARS clickers typically have either a benign or positive effect on student performance on exams, depending on the method and extent of their use, and create a more positive and active atmosphere in the large classroom. These systems are especially valuable as a means of introducing and monitoring peer learning methods in the large lecture classroom. So that the reader may use clickers effectively in his or her own classroom, a set of guidelines for writing good questions and a list of best-practice tips have been culled from the literature and experienced users.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT Authors have questioned the degree to which medical education research informs practice and advances the science of medical education. OBJECTIVE This study aims to propose a framework for classifying the purposes of education research and to quantify the frequencies of purposes among medical education experiments. METHODS We looked at articles published in 2003 and 2004 in Academic Medicine, Advances in Health Sciences Education, American Journal of Surgery, Journal of General Internal Medicine, Medical Education and Teaching and Learning in Medicine (1459 articles). From the 185 articles describing education experiments, a random sample of 110 was selected. The purpose of each study was classified as description (ÔWhat was done?Õ), justification (ÔDid it work?Õ)or clarification (ÔWhy or how did it work?Õ). Educational topics were identified inductively and each study was classified accordingly. RESULTS Of the 105 articles suitable for review, 75 (72\%) were justification studies, 17 (16\%) were description studies, and 13 (12\%) were clarification studies. Experimental studies of assessment methods (5 ⁄ 6, 83\%) and interventions aimed at knowledge and attitudes (5 ⁄ 28, 18\%) were more likely to be clarification studies than were studies addressing other educational topics ({$<$} 8\%). CONCLUSIONS Clarification studies are uncommon in experimental studies in medical education. Studies with this purpose (i.e. studies asking: ÔHow and why does it work?Õ) are needed to deepen our understanding and advance the art and science of medical education. We hope that this framework stimulates education scholars to reflect on the purpose of their inquiry and the research questions they ask, and to strive to ask more clarification questions.},

For most speakers, however, the problem is not with PowerPoint but with how they make use of it. Three approaches to making presentations using PowerPoint are described which should yield rich rewards and a more attentive and appreciative audience.},

Background: Clinical trials are required to establish treatment efficacy of many athletic training procedures. In the past, we have relied on evidence of questionable scientific merit to aid the determination of treatment choices. Interest in evidencebased practice is growing rapidly within the athletic training profession, placing greater emphasis on the importance of wellconducted clinical trials. One critical component of clinical trials that strengthens results is random assignment of participants to control and treatment groups. Although randomization appears to be a simple concept, issues of balancing sample sizes and controlling the influence of covariates a priori are important. Various techniques have been developed to account for these issues, including block, stratified randomization, and covariate adaptive techniques. Advantages: Athletic training researchers and scholarly clinicians can use the information presented in this article to better conduct and interpret the results of clinical trials. Implementing these techniques will increase the power and validity of findings of athletic medicine clinical trials, which will ultimately improve the quality of care provided.},

Twelve roles have previously been described for medical teachers, grouped into six major tasks: (1) the information provider; (2) the role model; (3) the facilitator; (4) the assessor; (5) the curriculum and course planner; and (6) the resource material creator (Harden \& Crosby 2000).It is clear that many of these roles require a teacher to be more than a medical expert. In a pure educational setting, teachers may have limited roles, but the clinical teacher often plays many roles simultaneously, switching from one role to another during the same encounter. The large majority of clinical teachers around the world have received rigorous training in medical knowledge and skills but little to none in teaching. As physicians become ever busier in their own clinical practice, being effective teachers becomes more challenging in the context of expanding clinical responsibilities and shrinking time for teaching (Prideaux et al. 2000). Clinicians on the frontline are often unaware of educational mandates from licensing and accreditation bodies as well as medical schools and postgraduate training programmes and this has major implications for staff training. Institutions need to provide necessary orientation and training for their clinical teachers. This Guide looks at the many challenges for teachers in the clinical environment, application of relevant educational theories to the clinical context and practical teaching tips for clinical teachers. This guide will concentrate on the hospital setting as teaching within the community is the subject of another AMEE guide.},

  abstract = {Background: To establish credible, defensible and acceptable passing scores for written tests is a challenge for health profession educators. Angoff procedures are often used to establish pass/fail decisions for written and performance tests. In an Angoff procedure judges' expertise and professional skills are assumed to influence their ratings of the items during standard-setting. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of judges' item-related knowledge on their judgement of the difficulty of items, and second, to determine the stability of differences between judges. Method: Thirteen judges were presented with two sets of 60 items on different occasions. They were asked to not only judge the difficulty of the items but also to answer them, without the benefit of the answer key. For each of the 120 items an Angoff estimate and an item score were obtained. The relationship between the Angoff estimate and the item score was examined by applying a regression analysis to the 60 items (Angoff estimate, score) for each judge at each occasion. Result and conclusions: This study shows that in standard-setting the individual judgement of the individual item is not only a reflection of the difficulty of the item but also of the inherent stringency of the judge and his/her subject-related knowledge. Considerable variation between judges in their stringency was found, and Angoff estimates were significantly affected by a judge knowing or not knowing the answer to the item. These findings stress the importance of a careful selection process of the Angoff judges when making pass/fail decisions in health professions education. They imply that judges should be selected who are not only capable of conceptualising the 'minimally competent student', but who would also be capable of answering all the items. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT In a recent study of the quality of reporting experimental studies in medical education, barely half the articles examined contained an explicit statement of the conceptual framework used. Conceptual frameworks represent ways of thinking about a problem or a study, or ways of representing how complex things work. They can come from theories, models or best practices. Conceptual frameworks illuminate and magnify one’s work. Different frameworks will emphasise different variables and outcomes, and their inter-relatedness. Educators and researchers constantly use conceptual frameworks to guide their work, even if they themselves are not consciously aware of the frameworks. METHODS Three examples are provided on how conceptual frameworks can be used to cast development and research projects in medical education. The examples are accompanied by commentaries and a total of 13 key points about the nature and use of conceptual frameworks. CONCLUSIONS Ultimately, scholars are responsible for making explicit the assumptions and principles contained in the conceptual framework(s) they use in their development and research projects.},

However, little is known of its impact on measurable knowledge acquisition. Results from this study showed that participation on discussion topics through Blackboard, an electronic discussion forum, predicted multiple‐choice test performance. In contrast, none of the traditional face‐to‐face feedback‐seeking behaviours, neither with professors in class or out of class, nor among fellow students, had significant influence on test results. An examination of underlying attitudes driving both electronic and face‐to‐face feedback‐seeking behaviours showed that competitiveness rather than cooperation drove average intensity of electronic board participation, which in turn, was related to participation across the number of electronic topical forums. The influencing role of competitiveness in this undergraduate student sample may indicate undergraduate students' lack of workplace experience, where cooperation rather than competition is often needed for workplace effectiveness. This and implications of other findings are discussed in the paper.},

Second, the posttest-only design is inherently stronger than the pretest–posttest design, provided the study is randomized and the sample is sufficiently large. Third, demonstrating the superiority of an educational intervention in comparison to no intervention does little to advance the art and science of education. Fourth, comparisons involving multifactorial interventions are hopelessly confounded, have limited application to new settings, and do little to advance our understanding of education. Fifth, single-group pretest–posttest studies are susceptible to numerous validity threats. Finally, educational interventions (including the comparison group) must be described in detail sufficient to allow replication.},

  abstract = {Background: At the 2009 AMEE meeting in Malaga, Spain, a workshop was held entitled ‘‘Medicine’s Social Contract with Society – An International Perspective.’’ Aims: One of the objectives of this workshop was to explore the international differences in medicine’s social contract with society, which is linked to the nature of professionalism. Methods: Nineteen individuals from 11 countries participated. They were asked to compare the expectations of the patients and the general public as well as those of the medical profession with those outlined in a recent publication addressing the issue from a North American perspective. Results: The results indicated that the role of the healer appears to be universal, with only minor differences being found in different cultures and countries. However, there were differences noted in the role of the professional, which of course must reflect national differences in the social contract in health care. Conclusion: These differences must be respected by those teaching professionalism. Introduction One of the most wonderful aspects of AMEE is its international character. Its meetings attract medical educators from around the world and provide opportunities for them to learn from each other. Because we believed that we could assemble an informed group of international participants, we organized a workshop entitled ‘‘Medicine’s Social Contract with Society – An International Perspective’’ at the 2009 AMEE meeting in Malaga, Spain. The results were sufficiently interesting that we believed that they justified dissemination and discussion.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is now a component of most medical curricula. Summative assessment instruments are often of debatable quality, do not cover the full spectrum of EBP or lack authenticity. Aim: To develop and evaluate the quality of an authentic assessment instrument for use in summative assessment of general practice trainees. Methods: An assignment was designed based on the ask, acquire, appraise and apply steps of EBP. Content validity was evaluated by external EBP experts. Concurrent validity was tested with the Fresno test. Inter-rater agreement and internal consistency were measured. Acceptability and feasibility were also assessed. Results: EBP experts agreed that the instrument had good content validity. Concurrent validity was good (disattenuated intraclass correlation coefficient 0.75). Inter-rater agreement varied from 0.70 to 0.83. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0.70–0.86). The procedure was feasible but only moderately acceptable to students. Conclusion: Our authentic assignment provided a valid, reliable and feasible procedure to assess our students. Acceptability was moderate, probably due to teething problems in instructions given and unfamiliarity with the format. Consequential validity data are lacking and would be of value. Our instrument could be an interesting alternative to other validated tests that may be less authentic.},

At the moment, the focus is still on the assessment of learning and not much on assessment for learning. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the implementation of authentic assessment in higher education in Malaysia. Approach: The study employed a qualitative research method and involved the use of instruments such as interviews, document analysis and unobtrusive classroom observations to collect the relevant data in the classrooms of a three-credit hour course from a Masters degree programme. The total population consisted of 2 lecturers and 20 students from the two selected intact TSL 752 classes. Results: In this study, researchers identified different types of authentic assessment with the suitability to certain pedagogical strategies, their effects on students’ learning and the appropriate procedures of conducting authentic assessments. The findings indicated that alternative and authentic assessment have more acceptance from students and should therefore be viewed as an alternative to traditional standardized assessment. Conclusion/Recommendations: The study identified that assessment strategies should be closely related to teaching and learning. Assessing authentic performances should become integral parts of the instructional cycle and feedback provided by the lecturer and peers should be formative in order to help the students assess their strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas of needed growth and mobilizing current capacity.},

  abstract = {Background: Competency-based education (CBE) has emerged in the health professions to address criticisms of contemporary approaches to training. However, the literature has no clear, widely accepted definition of CBE that furthers innovation, debate, and scholarship in this area. Aim: To systematically review CBE-related literature in order to identify key terms and constructs to inform the development of a useful working definition of CBE for medical education. Methods: We searched electronic databases and supplemented searches by using authors’ files, checking reference lists, contacting relevant organizations and conducting Internet searches. Screening was carried out by duplicate assessment, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. We included any English- or French-language sources that defined competency-based education. Data were analyzed qualitatively and summarized descriptively. Results: We identified 15,956 records for initial relevancy screening by title and abstract. The full text of 1,826 records was then retrieved and assessed further for relevance. A total of 173 records were analyzed. We identified 4 major themes (organizing framework, rationale, contrast with time, and implementing CBE) and 6 sub-themes (outcomes defined, curriculum of competencies, demonstrable, assessment, learner-centred and societal needs). From these themes, a new definition of CBE was synthesized. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive systematic review of the medical education literature related to CBE definitions. The themes and definition identified should be considered by educators to advance the field.},

The focus of usability testing is the user of the particular product and it informs product development by using a systematic process to identify usability problems at an early stage during product development so that these problems can be rectified. Usability testing of e-learning considers the characteristics of the learner, the technological aspects, the interaction and instructional design and finally the context. Testing under the conditions that the e-learning intervention will typically be used is the preferred method but more extreme situations can provide useful information. Product development should be iterative and rapid cycles of testing and refinement are essential to produce an effective e-learning intervention.},

  abstract = {Context Cognitive load theory aims to develop instructional design guidelines based on a model of human cognitive architecture. The architecture assumes a limited working memory and an unlimited long-term memory holding cognitive schemas; expertise exclusively comes from knowledge stored as schemas in long-term memory. Learning is described as the construction and automation of such schemas. Three types of cognitive load are distinguished: intrinsic load is a direct function of the complexity of the performed task and the expertise of the learner; extraneous load is a result of superfluous processes that do not directly contribute to learning, and germane load is caused by learning processes that deal with intrinsic cognitive load. Objectives This paper discusses design guidelines that will decrease extraneous load, manage intrinsic load and optimise germane load. Discussion Fifteen design guidelines are discussed. Extraneous load can be reduced by the use of goal-free tasks, worked examples and completion tasks, by integrating different sources of information, using multiple modalities, and by reducing redundancy. Intrinsic load can be managed by simple-to-complex ordering of learning tasks and working from low- to high-fidelity environments. Germane load can be optimised by increasing variability over tasks, applying contextual interference, and evoking self-explanation. The guidelines are also related to the expertise reversal effect, indicating that design guidelines for novice learners are different from guidelines for more experienced learners. Thus, well-designed instruction for novice learners is different from instruction for more experienced learners. Applications in health professional education and current research lines are discussed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, medical schools have tended to make assumptions that students will “automatically” engage in self-education effectively after graduation and subsequent training in residency and fellowships. In reality, the majority of medical graduates out in practice feel unprepared for learning on their own. Many medical schools are now adopting strategies and pedagogies to help students become self-regulating learners. Along with these changes in practices and pedagogy, many schools are eliminating a cornerstone of extrinsic motivation: discriminating grades. To study the effects of the switch from discriminating to pass–fail grading in the second year of medical school, we compared internal and external assessments and evaluations for a second-year class with a discriminating grading scale (Honors, High Pass, Pass, Fail) and for a second-year class with a pass–fail grading scale. Of the measures we compared (MCATs, GPAs, means on second-year examinations, USMLE Step 1 scores, residency placement, in which there were no statistically significant changes), the only statistically significant decreases (lower performance with pass fail) were found in two of the second-year courses. Performance in one other course also improved significantly. Pass–fail grading can meet several important intended outcomes, including “leveling the playing field” for incoming students with different academic backgrounds, reducing competition and fostering collaboration among members of a class, more time for extracurricular interests and personal activities. Pass–fail grading also reduces competition and supports collaboration, and fosters intrinsic motivation, which is key to self-regulated, lifelong learning.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a research model that examines the determinants of student learning satisfaction in a blended e-learning system (BELS) environment, based on social cognitive theory. The research model is tested using a questionnaire survey of 212 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test the reliability and validity of the measurements. The partial least squares (PLS) method was used to validate the measurement and hypotheses. The empirical findings indicate that computer self-efficacy, performance expectations, system functionality, content feature, interaction, and learning climate are the primary determinants of student learning satisfaction with BELS. The results also show that learning climate and performance expectations significantly affect learning satisfaction. Computer self-efficacy, system functionality, content feature and interaction significantly affect performance expectations. Interaction has a significant effect on learning climate. The findings provide insight into those factors that are likely significant antecedents for planning and implementing a blended e-learning system to enhance student learning satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Background  This study explored whether motivational, emotional, and behavioral aspects of self-regulated learning (SRL) are associated with academic performance in medical school.   Method  Across two academic years (2008 –2009 and 2009 –2010), 248 (73\%) of 342 second-year students in an introductory clinical reasoning course completed surveys assessing 10 SRL constructs.  Performance was operationalized as students’ average grade on three course exams, and a tercile split was used to compare those in the lowest and highest third of achievement using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance.   Results  Findings revealed differences in the beliefs and emotions of the two extreme groups, F(10,136) 2.08, P .03. Compared with high-performing students, low performers reported lower task value (Cohen d 0.33) and selfefficacy beliefs (d 0.33) as well as greater anxiety (d 0.63), frustration (d 0.54), and boredom (d 0.44).  Conclusions  Low-performing medical students in a clinical reasoning course demonstrated deficiencies in key SRL measures, providing insight for future, tailored remediation strategies.},

  abstract = {Why this textbook on measurement in medicine?Measurements are central to clinical practice and medical and health research. They form the basis of diagnosis, prognosis and evaluation of the results of medical interventions. Advances in diagnosis and care that were made possible, for example, by the widespread use of the Apgar scale and various imaging techniques, show the power of well-designed, appropriate measures. The key words here are ‘well-designed’ and ‘appropriate’. A decision-maker must know that the measure used is adequate for its purpose, how it compares with similar measures and how to interpret the results it produces.For every patient or population group, there are numerous instruments that can be used to measure clinical condition or health status, and new ones are still being developed. However, in the abundance of available instruments, many have been poorly or insufficiently validated. This book primarily serves as a guide to evaluate properties of existing measurement instruments in medicine, enabling researchers and clinicians to avoid using poorly validated ones or alerting them to the need for further validation.},

Many seek support, and some present complex problems that consume substantial resources. A few continue unresolved into postgraduate life and may affect future professional performance. Early intervention may be helpful in minimising the impact on both individual students and school resources. Aim: To develop a broad classification framework for personal problems presented by medical students to student support services. Methods: We report a study of more complex student problems presenting to student support services. A three stage iterative process, involving student support faculty from several international medical schools, discussed case scenarios based on pooled experience and developed a framework for categorising and considering management. Results: Seven profiles of student problems were developed, based on composites of unidentified cases drawn from participants’ experiences, reflecting: immaturity; learning skills; organisational skills; health or personal issues and poor insight. Broad characteristics and brief prognostic comments are provided for each profile. Discussion: While profiles may overlap and each student may have a unique set of issues, there appears to be similarities that allow some categorisation for management strategies and prognostic features in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Further work is needed to develop ‘diagnostic’ assessments that might guide intervention. Conclusion: This classification may assist early intervention into personal problems presented by medical students to student support services.},

In this symposium, panelists shared perspectives on medical education reform from throughout the world, including The Future of Medical Education in Canada, the role of regulators in contributing to reform, the evolution of accreditation standards, the current state of medical education in Southeast Asia, and the perspectives of a medical student on medical education reform. In the ‘‘Audience discussion’’ section, themes emerged surrounding medical education as a social good, the need for governmental support of medical education, the cost of medical education and the rise of for-profit medical schools, and embracing a broader view of health professional education. There remain remarkable parallels in calls for reform in medical education at the turn of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries but education which is patient-centered and actively involves the voices of our patients and our students is likely to be a hallmark.},

A third alternative, called regularized exploratory factor analysis, was introduced recently in the psychometric literature. Small sample size is an important issue that has received considerable discussion in the factor analysis literature. However, little is known about the differential performance of these three approaches to exploratory factor analysis in a small sample size scenario. A simulation study and an empirical example demonstrate that regularized exploratory factor analysis may be recommended over the two traditional approaches, particularly when sample sizes are small (below 50) and the sample covariance matrix is near singular.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of motivations distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Intrinsic motivation is observed when one engages in an activity out of genuine interest and is truly self-determined. Intrinsic motivation is the desired type of motivation for study as it is associated with deep learning, better performance and positive well-being in comparison to extrinsic motivation. It is dependent on the fulfilment of three basic psychological needs described by SDT. These are the needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. According to SDT, autonomy-supportive teaching is important, because it makes students feel autonomous and competent in their learning and also supported (relatedness) by their teachers. Aim: The concept of autonomy-supportive teaching is relevant to medical education, but less known. Through this article, we aim to make this concept understood and practically used by medical teachers. Methods: We used SDT literature as a basis to formulate these 12 tips. Results: We present 12 practical tips derived from SDT, for teachers in health professions, on how to engage in autonomysupportive teaching behaviours in order to stimulate intrinsic motivation in their students. Conclusion: These tips demonstrate that it is not difficult to engage in autonomy-supportive teaching behaviour. It can be learned through practice and self-reflection on teaching practices.},

  abstract = {Network meta-analysis, in the context of a systematic review, is a meta-analysis in which multiple treatments (that is, three or more) are being compared using both direct comparisons of interventions within randomized controlled trials and indirect comparisons across trials based on a common comparator. To ensure validity of findings from network meta-analyses, the systematic review must be designed rigorously and conducted carefully. Aspects of designing and conducting a systematic review for network meta-analysis include defining the review question, specifying eligibility criteria, searching for and selecting studies, assessing risk of bias and quality of evidence, conducting a network meta-analysis, interpreting and reporting findings. This commentary summarizes the methodologic challenges and research opportunities for network meta-analysis relevant to each aspect of the systematic review process based on discussions at a network metaanalysis methodology meeting we hosted in May 2010 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since this commentary reflects the discussion at that meeting, it is not intended to provide an overview of the field.},

  abstract = {The Flexner Report had its roots in the recognition in the mid-19th century that medical knowledge is not something fixed but something that grows and evolves.This new view of medical knowledge led to a recasting of the goal of medical education as that of instilling the proper techniques of acquiring and evaluating information rather than merely inculcating facts through rote memorization.Abraham Flexner, a brilliant educator, had the background to understand and popularize the meaning of this new view of education, and he took the unprecedented step of relating the developments in medical education to the ideas of John Dewey and the progressive education movement. Although the Flexner Report is typically viewed as a historical document—due to an understandable tendency to refer only to the second half of the report, where Flexner provides his famous critiques of the medical schools that existed at the time—this article argues that the Flexner Report is actually a living educational document of as much significance to medical educators today as in Flexner’s time.The article analyzes Flexner’s discussion of medical education and shows that his message—the importance of academic excellence, professional leadership, proper financial support, and service and altruism—is timeless, as applicable to the proper education of physicians today and tomorrow as in the past.},

A recent development in meta-analysis, multiple treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis, provides inferences on the comparative effectiveness of interventions that may have never been directly evaluated in clinical trials. This new approach may be confusing for clinicians and methodologists and raises specific challenges relevant to certain areas of medicine. This article addresses the methodological concepts of MTC meta-analysis, including issues of heterogeneity, choice of model, and adequacy of sample sizes. We address domain-specific challenges relevant to disciplines of medicine, including baseline risks of patient populations. We conclude that MTC meta-analysis is a useful tool in the context of comparative effectiveness and requires further study, as its utility and transparency will likely predict its uptake by the research and clinical community.},

It is intended for those who are contemplating conducting research in medical education but are new to the field. The Guide is structured around the process of transforming ideas and problems into researchable questions, choosing a research approach that is appropriate to the purpose of the study and considering the individual researcher's preferences and the contextual possibilities and constraints. The first section of the Guide addresses the rationale for research in medical education and some of the challenges posed by the complexity of the field. Next is a section on how to move from an idea or problem to a research question by placing a concrete idea or problem within a conceptual, theoretical framework. The following sections are structured around an overview model of approaches to medical education research, ‘The research compass’. Core to the model is the conceptual, theoretical framework that is the key to any direction. The compass depicts four main categories of research approaches that can be applied when studying medical education phenomena, ‘Explorative studies’; ‘Experimental studies’; ‘Observational studies’; and ‘Translational studies’. Future AMEE Guides in the research series will address these approaches in more detail.},

Extensive research across a variety of nonmedical disciplines has highlighted differences in key self-regulation processes between high- and low-achieving learners and performers. Structured identification of key self-regulation processes can be used to develop specific remediation approaches that can improve performance in academic and complex psycho-motor skills. General teaching approaches that are guided by a selfregulation perspective can also enhance academic performance. Self-regulation theory offers an exciting potential for improving academic and clinical performance in medical education.},

SDT research has been conducted in many areas, among which are education and health care, but its applications in medical education are rare. The potential of SDT to help understand processes in medical education justifies this Guide. SDT is explained in seven principles, one of which is the distinction of three innate psychological needs of human beings: for competence, for autonomy and for relatedness. Further, SDT elaborates how humans tend to internalise regulation of behaviour that initially has been external, in order to develop autonomous, self-determined behaviour. Implications of SDT for medical education are discussed with reference to preparation and selection, curriculum structure, classroom teaching, assessments and examinations, self-directed learning, clinical teaching, students as teachers and researchers, continuing professional development, faculty development and stress among trainees.},

  abstract = {Heutagogy, a form of self-determined learning with practices and principles rooted in andragogy, has recently resurfaced as a learning approach after a decade of limited attention. In a heutagogical approach to teaching and learning, learners are highly autonomous and self-determined and emphasis is placed on development of learner capacity and capability with the goal of producing learners who are well-prepared for the complexities of today’s workplace. The approach has been proposed as a theory for applying to emerging technologies in distance education and for guiding distance education practice and the ways in which distance educators develop and deliver instruction using newer technologies such as social media. The renewed interest in heutagogy is partially due to the ubiquitousness of Web 2.0, and the affordances provided by the technology. With its learner-centered design, Web 2.0 offers an environment that supports a heutagogical approach, most importantly by supporting development of learner-generated content and learner self-directedness in information discovery and in defining the learning path. Based on an extensive review of the current literature and research, this article defines and discusses the concepts of andragogy and heutagogy and describes the role of Web 2.0 in supporting a heutagogical learning approach. Examples of institutional programs that have incorporated heutagogical approaches are also presented; based on these examples and research results, course design elements that are characteristic of heutagogy are identified. The article provides a basis for discussion and research into heutagogy as a theory for guiding the use of new technologies in distance education.},

  abstract = {Objective: To identify and empirically investigate the dimensions of leadership in medical education and healthcare professions. Design: A population-based design with a focus group and a survey were used to identify the perceived competencies for effective leadership in medical education. Setting: The focus group, consisting of five experts from three countries (Austria n¼1; Germany n¼2; Switzerland n¼2), was conducted (all masters of medical education), and the survey was sent to health professionals from medical schools and teaching hospitals in six countries (Austria, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, the UK and the USA). Participants: The participants were educators, physicians, nurses and other health professionals who held academic positions in medical education. A total of 229 completed the survey: 135 (59.0\%) women (mean age¼50.3 years) and 94 (41.0\%) men (mean age¼51.0 years). Measures: A 63-item survey measuring leadership competencies was developed and administered via electronic mail to participants. Results: Exploratory principal component analyses yielded five factors accounting for 51.2\% of the variance: (1) social responsibility, (2) innovation, (3) self-management, (4) task management and (5) justice orientation. There were significant differences between physicians and other health professionals on some factors (Wilk’s l¼0.93, p{$<$}0.01). Social responsibility was rated higher by other health professionals (M¼71.09) than by physicians (M¼67.12), as was innovation (health professionals M¼80.83; physicians M¼76.20) and justice orientation (health professionals M¼21.27; physicians M¼20.46). Conclusions: The results of the principal component analyses support the theoretical meaningfulness of these factors, their coherence, internal consistency and parsimony in explaining the variance of the data. Although there are some between-group differences, the competencies appear to be stable and coherent.},

  abstract = {Medical education research has grown enormously over the past 20 years, but it does not sufficiently make use of theories, according to influential leaders and researchers in this field. In this AMEE Guide, it is argued that design-based research (DBR) studies should be conducted much more in medical education design research because these studies both advance the testing and refinement of theories and advance educational practice. In this Guide, the essential characteristics of DBR as well as how DBR differs from other approach such as formative evaluation are explained. It is also explained what the pitfalls and challenges of DBR are. The main challenges deal with how to insure that DBR studies reveal findings that are of a broader relevance than the local situation and how to insure that DBR contributes toward theory testing and refinement. An example of a series of DBR studies on the design of a teaching portfolio in higher education that is aimed at stimulating a teacher’s professional development is described, to illustrate how DBR studies actually work in practice. Finally, it is argued that DBR-studies could play an important role in the advancement of theory and practice in the two broad domains of designing or redesigning work-based learning environments and assessment programs.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges with research on student engagement is the large variation in the measurement of this construct, which has made it challenging to compare findings across studies. This chapter contributes to our understanding of the measurement of student in engagement in three ways. First, we describe strengths and limitations of different methods for assessing student engagement (i.e., self-report measures, experience sampling techniques, teacher ratings, interviews, and observations). Second, we compare and contrast 11 self-report survey measures of student engagement that have been used in prior research. Across these 11 measures, we describe what is measured (scale name and items), use of measure, samples, and the extent of reliability and validity information available on each measure. Finally, we outline limitations with current approaches to measurement and promising future directions.},

Educators can be more confident when choosing an appropriate evaluation model if they first consider the model’s theoretical basis against their program’s complexity and their own evaluation needs. Reductionism, system theory, and (most recently) complexity theory have inspired the development of models commonly applied in evaluation studies today. This Guide describes experimental and quasi-experimental models, Kirkpatrick’s four-level model, the Logic Model, and the CIPP (Context/Input/ Process/Product) model in the context of the theories that influenced their development and that limit or support their ability to do what educators need. The goal of this Guide is for educators to become more competent and confident in being able to design educational program evaluations that support intentional program improvement while adequately documenting or describing the changes and outcomes—intended and unintended—associated with their programs.},

We describe the concept of ‘competence’ and ‘competencies’ as well as the critical curricular implications that derive from a focus on ‘competence’ rather than ‘time’. These implications include: defining educational outcomes, developing individualized learning pathways, setting standards, and the centrality of valid assessment so as to reflect stakeholder priorities. We also highlight four challenges to implementing CBE: identifying the health needs of the community, defining competencies, developing self-regulated and flexible learning options, and assessing learners for competence. While CBE has been a prominent focus of educational reform in resource-rich countries, we believe it has even more potential to align educational programs with health system priorities in more resource-limited settings. Because CBE begins with a careful consideration of the competencies desired in the health professional workforce to address health care priorities, it provides a vehicle for integrating the health needs of the country with the values of the profession.},

This paper focuses on empathy in leadership, and presents the findings of a study conducted among business students over the course of 3 years. Finding that empathy consistently ranked lowest in the ratings, the researchers set out to discover the driving motives behind this invariable trend, and conducted a second study to obtain opinions about possible underlying factors. The paper presents the findings of both studies, as well as literature reviews on the differences between management and leadership, a historical overview of leadership, a reflection of 21st century leadership, the ongoing debate on the effects of corporate psychopaths on ethical performance, and scholars’ perception on empathy in corporate leadership. The findings indicate the need for a paradigm shift in corporations as well as business schools in regards to leaders’ required skills, and suggest a proactive approach from business faculty to change the current paradigm.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Professionalism is one of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's core competencies. Residency programs must teach residents about ethical principles, which is an essential component of professionalism.                                         Objectives               We aimed to formally develop a valid and reliable test of ethics knowledge that effectively discriminated among learners in pediatric residency training and to improve methods for measuring outcomes of resident education in medical ethics.                                         Methods               We created an instrument with 36 true/false questions that tested knowledge in several domains of pediatric ethics: professionalism, adolescent medicine, genetic testing and diagnosis, neonatology, end-of-life decisions, and decision making for minors. All questions and their correct answers were derived from published statements from the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics. We invited a range of participants from novices to experts to complete the test. We evaluated the instrument's reliability and explored item discrimination, omitting 13 items with the least discriminatory power. Score differences between the 3 categories of examinees were evaluated.                                         Results               The 23-item test, completed by 54 participants, demonstrated good internal reliability (Kuder-Richardson 20 statistic {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.73). The test was moderately difficult and had a mean overall score of 17.3 (±3.3 standard deviation). Performance appropriately improved with degree of expertise: median scores for medical students, postgraduate year-3 residents, and ethicists were 15 (65\%, range, 11–19), 19 (83\%, range, 14–23), and 22 (96\%, range, 20–23), respectively. Ethicists' scores were significantly higher than those of medical students (P \&lt; .001) and residents (P {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} .007). Moreover, residents performed significantly better than medical students (P {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} .001).                                         Conclusions               We developed a standardized instrument, entitled Test of Residents' Ethics Knowledge for Pediatrics (TREK-P), to evaluate residents' knowledge of pediatric ethics. The TREK-P is easy to administer, reliably discriminates among learners, and highlights content areas in which knowledge may be deficient.},

LGB individuals vary, however, both in how much they disclose their sexual orientation in different social contexts and in the experiences that follow from disclosure. The present research examines this within-person variation in disclosure and its consequences as a function of the autonomy supportive versus controlling character of social contexts. LGB individuals rated experiences of autonomy support and control in the contexts of family, friends, coworkers, school, and religious community, as well how “out” they were, and their context-specific self-esteem, depression, and anger. Findings from multilevel modeling revealed that LGB individuals were more likely to disclose in autonomy supportive contexts. Additionally, whereas disclosure was associated with more positive well-being in autonomy supportive contexts, in controlling contexts it was not. Practical and research implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: In light of the increasing recognition of the importance of physician scientists, and given the association between undergraduate research experiences with future scientific activity, it is important to identify and understand variables related to undergraduate students’ decision to engage in scientific research activities. The present study assessed the influence of individual characteristics, including personality traits and socio-demographic characteristics, on voluntary engagement in scientific research of undergraduate medical students. Methods: For this study, all undergraduate students and alumni of the School of Health Sciences in Minho, Portugal were invited to participate in a survey about voluntary engagement in scientific research activities. Data were available on socio-demographic, personality and university admission variables, as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. A regression model was used to compare (1) engaged with (2) not engaged students. A classification and regression tree model was used to compare students engaged in (3) elective curricular research (4) and extra-curricular research. Results: A total of 466 students (88\%) answered the survey. A complete set of data was available for 435 students (83\%). Higher scores in admission grade point average and the personality dimensions of “openness to experience” and “conscientiousness” increased chances of engagement. Higher “extraversion” scores had the opposite effect. Male undergraduate students were two times more likely than females to engage in curricular elective scientific research and were also more likely to engage in extra-curricular research activities. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that student’ grade point average and individual characteristics, like gender, openness and consciousness have a unique and statistically significant contribution to students’ involvement in undergraduate scientific research activities.},

We then outline the principles underlying the grounded theory approach and the procedures for doing a grounded theory study, illustrating these elements with real examples. Next, we address key critiques of grounded theory, which continue to shape how the method is perceived and used. Finally, pitfalls and controversies in grounded theory research are examined to provide a balanced view of both the potential and the challenges of this approach. This Guide aims to assist researchers new to grounded theory to approach their studies in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, to challenge experienced researchers to reflect on their assumptions, and to arm readers of medical education research with an approach to critically appraising the quality of grounded theory studies.},

  abstract = {The role and status of theory is by no means a new topic in medical education. Yet summarizing where we have been and where we are going with respect to theory development and application is difficult because our community has not yet fully elucidated what constitutes medical education theory. In this article, we explore the idea of conceptualizing theory as an effect on scholarly dialogue among medical educators. We describe theory-enabled conversation as argumentation, which frames inquiry, permits the evaluation of evidence, and enables the acquisition of community understanding that has utility beyond investigators’ local circumstances. We present ideas for assessing argumentation quality and suggest approaches to increasing the frequency and quality of argumentation in the exchange among diverse medical education scholars.},

  abstract = {This AMEE Guide offers an introduction to the use of databases in medical education research. It is intended for those who are contemplating conducting research in medical education but are new to the field. The Guide is structured around the process of planning your research so that data collection, management and analysis are appropriate for the research question. Throughout we consider contextual possibilities and constraints to educational research using databases, such as the resources available, and provide concrete examples of medical education research to illustrate many points. The first section of the Guide explains the difference between different types of data and classifying data, and addresses the rationale for research using databases in medical education. We explain the difference between qualitative research and qualitative data, the difference between categorical and quantitative data, and the difference types of data which fall into these categories. The Guide reviews the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research. The next section is structured around how to work with quantitative and qualitative databases and provides guidance on the many practicalities of setting up a database. This includes how to organise your database, including anonymising data and coding, as well as preparing and describing your data so it is ready for analysis. The critical matter of the ethics of using databases in medical educational research, including using routinely collected data versus data collected for research purposes, and issues of confidentiality, is discussed. Core to the Guide is drawing out the similarities and differences in working with different types of data and different types of databases. Future AMEE Guides in the research series will address statistical analysis of data in more detail.},

  abstract = {Mark Twain once observed, A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on. His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others--struggle to make their ideas stick. Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds-from the infamous kidney theft ring hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits. Made to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)--the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas-and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.

Different teams looking after various aspects of OSCE need to work collaboratively for an effective question bank development, examiner training and standardised patients' training. Quality assurance is an ongoing process taking place throughout the OSCE cycle. In order for the OSCE to generate reliable results it is essential to pay attention to each and every element of quality assurance, as poorly standardised patients, untrained examiners, poor quality questions and inappropriate scoring rubrics each will affect the reliability of the OSCE. The validity will also be influenced if the questions are not realistic and mapped against the learning outcomes of the teaching programme.

  abstract = {The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was first described by Harden in 1975 as an alternative to the existing methods of assessing clinical performance (Harden et al. 1975). The OSCE was designed to improve the validity and reliability of assessment of performance, which was previously assessed using the long case and short case examinations. Since then the use of the OSCE has become widespread within both undergraduate and postgraduate clinical education. We recognise that the introduction of the OSCE into an existing assessment programme is a challenging process requiring a considerable amount of theoretical and practical knowledge. The two parts of this Guide are designed to assist all those who intend implementing the OSCE into their assessment systems. Part I addresses the theoretical aspects of the OSCE, exploring its historical development, its place within the range of assessment tools and its core applications. Part II offers more practical information on the process of implementing an OSCE, including guidance on developing OSCE stations, choosing scoring rubrics, training examiners and standardised patients and managing quality assurance processes. Together we hope these two parts will act as a useful resource both for those choosing to implement the OSCE for the first time and also those wishing to quality assure their existing OSCE programme. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

  abstract = {In any evaluation system of medical trainees there is an underlying set of assumptions about what is to be evaluated (i.e., which goals reflect the values of the system or institution), what kind of observations or assessments are useful to allow judgments1; and how these are to be analyzed and compared to a standard of what is to be achieved by the learner. These assumptions can be conventionalized into a framework for evaluation. Frameworks encompass, or ‘‘frame,’’ a group of ideas or categories to reflect the educational goals against which a trainee’s level of competence or progress is gauged. Different frameworks provide different ways of looking at the practice of medicine and have different purposes. In the first place, frameworks should enable educators to determine to what extent trainees are ready for advancement, that is, whether the desired competence has been attained. They should provide both a valid mental model of competence and also terms to describe successful performance, either at the end of training or as milestones during the curriculum. Consequently, such frameworks drive learning by providing learners with a guide for what is expected. Frameworks should also enhance consistency and reliability of ratings across staff and settings. Finally, they determine the content of, and resources needed for, rater training to achieve consistency of use. This is especially important in clinical rotations, in which reliable assessments have been most difficult to achieve. Because the limitations of workplace-based assessment have persisted despite the use of traditional frameworks (such as those based on knowledge, skills, and attitudes), this Guide will explore the assumptions and characteristics of traditional and newer frameworks. In this AMEE Guide, we make a distinction between analytic, synthetic, and developmental frameworks. Analytic frameworks deconstruct competence into individual pieces, to evaluate each separately. Synthetic frameworks attempt to view competence holistically, focusing evaluation on the performance in real-world activities. Developmental frameworks focus on stages of, or milestones, in the progression toward competence. Most frameworks have one predominant perspective; some have a hybrid nature.},

  abstract = {Mixed methods research is the use of quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study or series of studies. It is an emergent methodology which is increasingly used by health researchers, especially within health services research. There is a growing literature on the theory, design and critical appraisal of mixed methods research. However, there are few papers that summarize this methodological approach for health practitioners who wish to conduct or critically engage with mixed methods studies. The objective of this paper is to provide an accessible introduction to mixed methods for clinicians and researchers unfamiliar with this approach. We present a synthesis of key methodological literature on mixed methods research, with examples from our own work and that of others, to illustrate the practical applications of this approach within health research. We summarize definitions of mixed methods research, the value of this approach, key aspects of study design and analysis, and discuss the potential challenges of combining quantitative and qualitative methods and data. One of the key challenges within mixed methods research is the successful integration of quantitative and qualitative data during analysis and interpretation. However, the integration of different types of data can generate insights into a research question, resulting in enriched understanding of complex health research problems.},

In the behavioural and social sciences, these two paradigms are compared to reveal their relative strengths and weaknesses. But the debate about both traditions has commonly taken place in academic books. It is hard to find an article that deals with the generic issues related to the quantitative and qualitative divide by drawing on distinguished research literature. Interested in addressing this need, this article aims to explain the essential characteristics of quantitative and qualitative research approaches with an emphasis on their underlying epistemological, theoretical, and methodological differences. It elucidates the research design issues and concepts in relation to both research paradigms, from planning research to collecting and analyzing data, and reporting findings. The criteria that are used to evaluate research strategies and findings are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A guide to thirty-five creative assignments for pairs and groups Collaborative Learning Techniques is the bestseller that college and university faculty around the world have used to help them make the most of small group learning. A mountain of evidence shows that students who learn in small groups together exhibit higher academic achievement, motivation, and satisfaction than those who don't. Collaborative learning puts into practice the major conclusion from learning theory: that students must be actively engaged in building their own minds. In this book, the authors synthesize the relevant research and theory to support thirty-five collaborative learning activities for use in both traditional and online classrooms. This second edition reflects the changed world of higher education. New technologies have opened up endless possibilities for college teaching, but it's not always easy to use these technologies effectively. Updated to address the challenges of today's new teaching environments, including online, "flipped," and large lectures, Collaborative Learning Techniques is a wonderful reference for educators who want to make the most of any course environment. This revised and expanded edition includes: Additional techniques, with an all-new chapter on using games to provide exciting, current, technologically-sophisticated curricula A section on effective online implementation for each of the thirty-five techniques Significantly expanded pedagogical rationale and updates on the latest research showing how and why collaborative learning works Examples for implementing collaborative learning techniques in a variety of learning environments, including large lecture classes and "flipped" classes Expanded guidance on how to solve common problems associated with group work The authors guide instructors through all aspects of group work, providing a solid grounding in what to do, how to do it, and why it is important for student learning. The detailed procedures in Collaborative Learning Techniques will help teachers make sure group activities go smoothly, no matter the size or delivery method of their classes. With practical advice on how to form student groups, assign roles, build team spirit, address unexpected problems, and evaluate and grade student participation, this new edition of the international classic makes incorporating effective group work easy},

  abstract = {"The Freakonomics of math -- a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands. The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn't confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do -- the whole world is shot through with it. Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It's a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does "public opinion" really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician's method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman -- minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia's views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can't figure out about you, and the existence of God. Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is "an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength." With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how."},

As hypothesized, strong and significant positive correlations (.80) were found between the SSEM and the 2 measures of engagement (the School Engagement Measure and the Student Engagement Instrument). Also as hypothesized, a weak but significant positive correlation (.35) was found between the SSEM and a measure of life satisfaction (the Student Life Satisfaction Survey). These findings provide additional support for using the SSEM as a valid measure of adolescents’ engagement with school.},

In Study II, university freshmen who studied applications of Bayes’ theorem in exampleeexample (n ¼ 18) or exampleeproblem (n ¼ 18) condition demonstrated better posttest performance than their peers who studied the applications in problemeexample (n ¼ 18) or problemeproblem (n ¼ 20) condition, and a slightly modified version of the aforementioned psychometric instrument could help researchers to differentiate intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load.

In each chapter, he describes a brain rule--what scientists know for sure about how our brains work--and then offers transformative ideas for our daily lives. You'll learn why Michael Jordan was no good at baseball. You'll peer over a surgeon's shoulder as he proves that most of us have a Jennifer Aniston neuron. You'll meet a boy who has an amazing memory for music but can't tie his own shoes. You will discover how: every brain is wired differently, exercise improves cognition, we are designed to never stop learning and exploring, memories are volatile, sleep is powerfully linked with the ability to learn, vision trumps all of the other senses, and stress changes the way we learn},

In this chapter, we identify and explore several theories from the domain of psychology to provide this foundation. This includes the theory of gamified instructional design, classic conditioning theories of learning, expectancy-based theories, goal-setting theory, and self-determination theory. For each theory (or family of theories), we describe the theory itself, relate it to gamification research, and identify the most promising future research directions given that basis. In exploring these theories, we conclude that gamification is not a “new” instructional technique per se but is instead a new combination and presentation of classic motivational techniques. This combination may provide unique value over other approaches, but this is an unresolved empirical question. We conclude by making specific recommendations for both gamification researchers and practitioners to best advance the study of gamification given this sturdy theoretical basis.},

We argue that certain practices create a psychologically safe context for learning, a socalled safe container. Establishing a safe container, in turn, allows learners to engage actively in simulation plus debriefings despite possible disruptions to that engagement such as unrealistic aspects of the simulation, potential threats to their professional identity, or frank discussion of mistakes. Establishing a psychologically safe context includes the practices of (1) clarifying expectations, (2) establishing a ‘‘fiction contract’’ with participants, (3) attending to logistic details, and (4) declaring and enacting a commitment to respecting learners and concern for their psychological safety. As instructors collaborate with learners to perform these practices, consistency between what instructors say and do may also impact learners’ engagement.},

  abstract = {In the spirit of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. This paperback includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested readings, and more. Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions--both big and small--have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented. We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse. By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counterintuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on the important ones and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make},

  abstract = {Background: Use of theory is essential for advancing the science of knowledge translation (KT) and for increasing the likelihood that KT interventions will be successful in reducing existing research-practice gaps in health care. As a sociological theory of knowledge, social constructivist theory may be useful for informing the design and evaluation of KT interventions. As such, this scoping review explored the extent to which social constructivist theory has been applied in the KT literature for healthcare professionals. Methods: Searches were conducted in six databases: Ovid MEDLINE (1948 – May 16, 2011), Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycInfo, and AMED. Inclusion criteria were: publications from all health professions, research methodologies, as well as conceptual and theoretical papers related to KT. To be included in the review, key words such as constructivism, social constructivism, or social constructivist theories had to be included within the title or abstract. Papers that discussed the use of social constructivist theories in the context of undergraduate learning in academic settings were excluded from the review. An analytical framework of quantitative (numerical) and thematic analysis was used to examine and combine study findings. Results: Of the 514 articles screened, 35 papers published between 1992 and 2011 were deemed eligible and included in the review. This review indicated that use of social constructivist theory in the KT literature was limited and haphazard. The lack of justification for the use of theory continues to represent a shortcoming of the papers reviewed. Potential applications and relevance of social constructivist theory in KT in general and in the specific studies were not made explicit in most papers. For the acquisition, expression and application of knowledge in practice, there was emphasis on how the social constructivist theory supports clinicians in expressing this knowledge in their professional interactions. Conclusions: This scoping review was the first to examine use of social constructivism in KT studies. While the links between social constructivism and KT have not been fully explored, the Knowledge to Action framework has strong constructivist underpinnings that can be used in moving forward within the broader KT enterprise.},

The 12 tips provide guidance to organisations and individual providers that encourages implementation of good practice and helps them better visualise their role within the system. By following the tips, medical schools can make more effective provisions for the expected, diverse and sometimes specialist needs of their students. Schools must take a proactive, anticipatory approach to provide appropriately for their entire student body. This ensures that students receive the best quality support, are more likely to succeed and are adequately prepared for their medical careers.},

Aims: To verify the value of a new exam two weeks into medical school as a predictor of failure, and explore the requirements for a preventative intervention. Methods: Students who failed the two-week exam were invited to a series of large-group workshops and small-group follow-up meetings. Participants’ subsequent exam performance was compared with non-participants. Results: About 71\% of students who performed poorly in the new exam subsequently failed a course. Attendance at the workshops made no difference to short- or long-term pass rates. Attendance at more than three follow-up small group sessions significantly improved pass rates two semesters later, and was influenced by teacher experience. Conclusions: Close similarity between predictor task and target task is important for accurate prediction of failure. Consideration should be given to dose effect and class size in the prevention of failure of at-risk students, and we recommend a systemic approach to intervention/remediation programmes, involving a whole semester of mandatory, weekly small group meetings with experienced teachers.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) builds upon established models of human memory that include the subsystems of sensory, working and long-term memory. Working memory (WM) can only process a limited number of information elements at any given time. This constraint creates a ‘‘bottleneck’’ for learning. CLT identifies three types of cognitive load that impact WM: intrinsic load (associated with performing essential aspects of the task), extraneous load (associated with non-essential aspects of the task) and germane load (associated with the deliberate use of cognitive strategies that facilitate learning). When the cognitive load associated with a task exceeds the learner’s WM capacity, performance and learning is impaired. To facilitate learning, CLT researchers have developed instructional techniques that decrease extraneous load (e.g. worked examples), titrate intrinsic load to the developmental stage of the learner (e.g. simplify task without decontextualizing) and ensure that unused WM capacity is dedicated to germane load, i.e. cognitive learning strategies. A number of instructional techniques have been empirically tested. As learners’ progress, curricula must also attend to the expertise-reversal effect. Instructional techniques that facilitate learning among early learners may not help and may even interfere with learning among more advanced learners. CLT has particular relevance to medical education because many of the professional activities to be learned require the simultaneous integration of multiple and varied sets of knowledge, skills and behaviors at a specific time and place. These activities possess high ‘‘element interactivity’’ and therefore impose a cognitive load that may surpass the WM capacity of the learner. Applications to various medical education settings (classroom, workplace and self-directed learning) are explored.},

  abstract = {Background: Medical students’ motivation is an important driving factor for academic performance, and therefore medical teachers and educators are often highly interested in this topic. This study evaluated the impact of an academic affair program upon preclinical year medical students’ motivation to study. Design and methods: An intervention study was conducted using a pretest-posttest study design. A total of 296 preclinical year medical students who had just passed their first year and were about to attend their second year at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, participated in the study. The intervention comprised of dialogues for personality development, pictorial expression in groups, as well as small group lectures delivered by senior students giving information on how to prepare for the forthcoming classes. Students’ academic motivation was measured before and after the intervention program, applying the transculturally translated Academic Motivation Scale (AMS). Cronbach’s alpha of Thai version AMS was 0.8992. The average scores in seven scales of AMS were compared between the pre- and posttest results, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The differences were confirmed by using the multivariate analysis of variance. Results: Students’ academic motivation increased after participation in the three-day academic program. There was also a significant increase in introjected extrinsic motivation, which can enhance the students’ self-esteem and feeling of self-worth (P,0.001). Moreover, intrinsic motivation toward accomplishment increased significantly (P,0.001). This is related to the enjoyment of passing academic milestones, and a step ahead of autonomous motivation. Amotivation level declined significantly (P,0.001). The change of academic motivational constructs before and after the intervention was altogether significant (P=0.036, multivariate analysis of variance). Conclusion: After experiencing a three-day intervention, the new students’ motivation advanced along the continuum of self-determination toward autonomous motivation. Therefore, it is considered to be worthwhile conducting an academic intervention to catalyze the evolution of preclinical year medical students’ academic motivation. Moreover, educators and faculties should evaluate the impact of interventions in evidence-based approaches to secure both controlled and autonomous types of motivation.},

  abstract = {The usability of computer interfaces has a major influence on learning. Optimising the usability of e-learning resources is therefore essential. However, this may be neglected because of time and monetary constraints. User testing is a common approach to usability evaluation and involves studying typical end-users interacting with the application being tested. Determining the minimum number of users that are required for such an evaluation is important as it has a direct bearing on the costs and time requirements. This issue has long been a subject of debate and the widely cited recommendation of five users being enough has been questioned. We conducted a usability evaluation of an e-learning resource for electrolyte and acid-base disorders by studying the interaction of medical doctors with the application. A total of 15 serious usability problems were detected, most of these related to an interactive treatment simulation. With this report, we are making available the data on the detection of serious usability problems by each of our participants. We have used these data to run a Monte Carlo simulation and examine how many users would be sufficient to test our application. The simulation revealed that we would have required 10 participants to detect 80\% of the serious usability problems. The MATLAB® code for running the simulation is supplied, as are our calculations of problem discovery rates. The e-learning resource which was evaluated is freely available, together with a revised version with all identified usability problems addressed.},

An experimental design was used with half of the students randomly assigned to receive these interventions via email and the other half being analyzed for at-risk triggers but receiving no intervention. Pre-course surveys on student motivation [4] and prior subject matter knowledge were conducted, and students were asked to maintain weekly logs of their activity online and offline connected to the courses. Regression analyses, incorporating feature selection methods to account for student demographic data, were used to compare the impact of the interventions between the control and experimental groups. Results showed that the interventions were associated with a higher final grade in one course, but only for a particular demographic group.},

The instrument offers practitioners and academic researchers the opportunity to apply the scale both for internal monitoring and knowledge sharing as well as further research. The development process of the CVQ scale demonstrates how the qualitative method can serve as a distinct research stage and at the same time support and enhance the quantitative one, thus contributing to the validity and applicability of the instrument.},

  abstract = {In a knowledge and information society, e-learning has built on the extensive use of advanced information and communication technologies to deliver learning and instruction. In addition, employees who need the training do not have to gather in a place at the same time, and thus it is not necessary for them to travel far away for attending training courses. Furthermore, the flexibility allows employees who perform different jobs or tasks for training courses according to their own scheduling. Since many studies have discussed learning and training of employees and most of them are focused on the learning emotion, learning style, educational content, and technology, there is limited research exploring the relationship between the e-learning and employee’s satisfaction. Therefore, this study aims to explore how to enhance employee’s satisfaction by means of e-learning systems, and what kinds of training or teaching activities are effective to increase their learning satisfaction. We provide a model and framework for assessing the impact of e-learning on employee’s satisfaction which improve learning and teaching outcomes. Findings from the study confirmed the validity of the proposed model for e-learning satisfaction assessment. In addition, the results showed that the four variables technology, educational content, motivation, and attitude significantly influenced employee’s learning satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Contemporary literature on online and distance education almost unequivocally argues for the importance of interactions in online learning settings. Nevertheless, the relationship between different types of interactions and learning outcomes is rather complex. Analyzing 204 offerings of 29 courses, over the period of six years, this study aimed at expanding the current understanding of the nature of this relationship. Specifically, with the use of trace data about interactions and utilizing the multilevel linear mixed modeling techniques, the study examined whether frequency and duration of studentestudent, studenteinstructor, studentesystem, and studentecontent interactions had an effect of learning outcomes, measured as final course grades. The findings show that the time spent on studentesystem interactions had a consistent and positive effect on the learning outcome, while the quantity of studentecontent interactions was negatively associated with the final course grades. The study also showed the importance of the educational level and the context of individual courses for the interaction types supported. Our findings further confirmed the potential of the use of trace data and learning analytics for studying learning and teaching in online settings. However, further research should account for various qualitative aspects of the interactions used while learning, different pedagogical/media features, as well as for the course design and delivery conditions in order to better explain the association between interaction types and the learning achievement. Finally, the results might imply the need for the development of the institutional and program-level strategies for learning and teaching that would promote effective pedagogical approaches to designing and guiding interactions in online and distance learning settings.},

  abstract = {A substantial part of medical education research focuses on learning in teams (e.g., departments, problembased learning groups) or centres (e.g., clinics, institutions) that are followed over time. Individual students or employees sharing the same team or centre tend to be more similar in learning than students or employees from different teams or centres. In other words, when students or employees are nested within teams or centres, there is a within-team or within-centre correlation that should be taken into account in the analysis of data obtained from individuals in these teams or centres. Further, when individuals are measured several times on the same performance (or other) variable, these repeated measurements tend to be correlated, that is: we are dealing with an intra-individual correlation that should be taken into account when analyzing data obtained from these individuals. In such a study context, many researchers resort to methods that cannot account for intra-team and/or intra-individual correlation and this may result in incorrect conclusions with regard to effects and relations of interest. This comparison paper presents the benefits which result from adopting a proper multilevel perspective on the conceptualization and estimation of effects and relations of interest.},

Unfortunately, misconceptions such as lower cognitive load always being beneficial to learning and the continued use of dated concepts and methods can result in improper applications of CLT principles in medical education design and research. This review outlines how CLT has evolved and presents a synthesis of current-day CLT principles in a holistic model for medical education design. This model distinguishes three dimensions: task fidelity: from literature (lowest) through simulated patients to real patients (highest); task complexity: the number of information elements; and instructional support: from worked examples (highest) through completion tasks to autonomous task performance (lowest). These three dimensions together constitute three steps to proficient learning: (I) start with high support on low-fidelity low-complexity tasks and gradually fade that support as learners become more proficient; (II) repeat I for low-fidelity but higher-complexity tasks; and (III) repeat I and II in that order at subsequent levels of fidelity. The numbers of fidelity levels and complexity levels within fidelity levels needed depend on the aims of the course, curriculum or individual learning trajectory. This paper concludes with suggestions for future research based on this model.},

The results reveal that an instructor's course preparation is significantly positively related to the students' viewing activities, while instructor's guidance and assistance has a significant impact on the students' completing learning tasks. The study also indicates that the students' viewing activities have a direct positive influence on their completing learning tasks activities. Students' completing learning tasks exert direct positive influence on their interaction for learning, while their viewing activities have an indirect impact on their interaction activities.},

This article describes the uneven yet successful dissemination of a simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) curriculum on central venous catheter (CVC) insertion for internal medicine and emergency medicine residents across medical education settings. The dissemination program was grounded in implementation science principles. The article begins by describing implementation science which addresses the mechanisms of medical education and health care delivery. The authors then present a mastery learning case study in two phases: (1) the development, implementation, and evaluation of the SBML CVC curriculum at a tertiary care academic medical center; and (2) the dissemination of the SBML CVC curriculum to an academic community hospital setting. Contextual information about the drivers and barriers that affected the SBML CVC curriculum dissemination is presented. This work demonstrates that dissemination of mastery learning curricula, like all other medical education innovations, will fail without active educational leadership, personal contacts, dedication, hard work, rigorous measurement, and attention to implementation science principles. The article concludes by presenting a set of lessons learned about disseminating an SBML CVC curriculum across different medical education settings.},

METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 55 students who had failed the final re-sit assessment at two medical schools in the UK to explore their use of SRL processes. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify the factors, from an SRL perspective, that prevented students from appropriately and adaptively overcoming failure, and confined them to a cycle of recurrent failure. RESULTS Struggling students did not utilise key SRL processes, which caused them to make inappropriate choices of learning strategies for written and clinical formats of assessment, and to use maladaptive strategies for coping with failure. Their normalisation of the experience and external attribution of failure represented barriers to their taking up of formal support and seeking informal help from peers. CONCLUSIONS This study identified that struggling students had problems with SRL, which caused them to enter a cycle of failure as a result of their limited attempts to access formal and informal support. Implications for how medical schools can create a culture that supports the seeking of help and the development of SRL, and improves remediation for struggling students, are discussed.},

Monitoring and predicting the students' encounter diseases (EDs) is important for providing an optimal experience. EDs should be compared with the available diseases (ADs) at the clerkship site and with the required diseases described in some guidelines for the clinical curriculum. Aims: To explore the differences in ADs as learning resources among different types of clerkship sites and to investigate discrepancies between EDs and ADs. Method: A retrospective observational study used secondary data from government statistics to compare ADs of various types of observable clerkship sites by biplot analyses, which allowed multivariate comparisons. EDs collected from logbooks during clerkships at a university hospital were also compared with ADs across sites. Results: The distributions of ADs differed according to institutional type, and EDs at Kyushu University Hospital were similar to the ADs for the category of hospitals in which it was placed. Conclusion: EDs at a clerkship site may be predictable to some extent by analysing the site's distribution of ADs, but further study is needed. Biplot is useful for visualising these types of statistical similarity.},

  abstract = {E-learning systems are enablers in the learning process, strengthening their importance as part of the educational strategy. Understanding the determinants of e-learning success is crucial for defining instructional strategies. Several authors have studied e-learning implementation and adoption, and various studies have addressed e-learning success from different perspectives. However, none of these studies have verified whether students' cultural characteristics, such as individualism versus collectivism (individualism/collectivism), play a determinant role in the perceived e-learning success. This study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of students' cultural characteristics, for individualism/collectivism, on the perceived outcomes of e-learning systems use. This study proposes an e-learning systems success model that includes a cultural construct, individualism/ collectivism. This paper reports an empirical study developed through an electronic survey distributed to higher education students belonging to various learning levels and from various universities. The study applies quantitative methods to obtain results. Our findings demonstrate that learners' perceived individual impact is positively influenced by their satisfaction and e-learning systems' use. Results demonstrate the determinant role of individualism/collectivism on individual and organizational impacts. Students influenced by collective culture perceive more individual and organizational impacts than individualistic culture students. Individualism/collectivism also moderates the users' perceived satisfaction on individual impact, and from individual impacts to organizational impacts. The result shows that for the students with a stronger individualistic culture, satisfaction plays a central role in the way they assess the individual impacts, and individual impacts on organizational impacts. This empirical research discusses the theoretical and practical implications.},

The results from Survey 1 indicated that online students reported significantly lower levels of relatedness than their on-campus counterparts. Follow-up interviews were conducted with purposefully chosen students and faculty members. The findings suggested that four themes impact synchronous hybrid learning: peer relatedness, technology influence, instructor impact, and program structure. In vivo quotations were used to develop a scale to assess participants' self-efficacy of relatedness development. Survey 2 data indicated that the new scale had good psychometric quality and that students reported significantly greater levels of self-efficacy for relatedness development with classmates in their same attendance mode than with peers in the opposite format.},

Background: It is often difficult for junior qualitative researchers to pull together the tools and resources they need to embark on a high-quality qualitative research study and to manage the volumes of data they collect during qualitative studies. This paper seeks to pull together much needed resources and provide an overview of methods. Methods: A step-by-step guide to planning a qualitative descriptive study and analyzing the data is provided, utilizing exemplars from the authors’ research. Results: This paper presents steps to conducting a qualitative descriptive study under the following headings: describing the qualitative descriptive approach, designing a qualitative descriptive study, steps to data analysis, and ensuring rigor of findings. Conclusions: The qualitative descriptive approach results in a summary in everyday, factual language that facilitates understanding of a selected phenomenon across disciplines of health science researchers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To succinctly summarise five contemporary theories about motivation to learn, articulate key intersections and distinctions among these theories, and identify important considerations for future research. RESULTS Motivation has been defined as the process whereby goal-directed activities are initiated and sustained. In expectancy-value theory, motivation is a function of the expectation of success and perceived value. Attribution theory focuses on the causal attributions learners create to explain the results of an activity, and classifies these in terms of their locus, stability and controllability. Socialcognitive theory emphasises self-efficacy as the primary driver of motivated action, and also identifies cues that influence future self-efficacy and support self-regulated learning. Goal orientation theory suggests that learners tend to engage in tasks with concerns about mastering the content (mastery goal, arising from a ‘growth’ mindset regarding intelligence and learning) or about doing better than others or avoiding failure (performance goals, arising from a ‘fixed’ mindset). Finally, self-determination theory proposes that optimal performance results from actions motivated by intrinsic interests or by extrinsic values that have become integrated and internalised. Satisfying basic psychosocial needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness promotes such motivation. Looking across all five theories, we note recurrent themes of competence, value, attributions, and interactions between individuals and the learning context. CONCLUSIONS To avoid conceptual confusion, and perhaps more importantly to maximise the theory-building potential of their work, researchers must be careful (and precise) in how they define, operationalise and measure different motivational constructs. We suggest that motivation research continue to build theory and extend it to health professions domains, identify key outcomes and outcome measures, and test practical educational applications of the principles thus derived.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Breaking bad news is a difficult skill that can elicit significant distress among learners. As such, it is important for learners to practice this skill in a controlled environment, which affords time to address any distress that arises and the opportunity to receive supportive feedback on performance. This breaking bad news module was designed for preclerkship students with previous training in basic communication skills and served as capstone to the preclerkship portion of the communication skills curriculum. Methods: The small-group session was delivered to groups of 10-12 students and facilitated by a faculty member with expertise in communication skills. The small-group session included approximately 60 minutes of didactics and discussion, followed by a 30-minute faculty demonstration with simulated patients (SPs). Learners then had 30 minutes to practice with the SPs and received constructive feedback from the SPs and the faculty facilitator. Approximately 1 week following the small-group module, learners participated in an individual encounter with an SP and were assessed on physical examination skills and communication skills. Learners received detailed evaluations and feedback on breaking bad news skills from the SPs. Finally, learners had individual feedback meetings with their faculty facilitator, who reviewed the videotaped encounters, focusing on performance and experience of breaking bad news to the SP. Results: In the 2015-2016 academic year, 217 medical students participated in this module. Learners demonstrated proficiency in the physical exam skills with 90\% of learners asking about 5/8 components of the presenting complaint and 85\% performing 5/8 physical exam maneuvers correctly. Similarly learners demonstrated expected levels of competence in interpersonal and communication skills. Discussion: This learning exercise provided training in a critical communication skill but also supplied a framework for assessing and responding to personal and patient distress.},

Participants completed the General Intellectual Humility Scale, an incidental old/new recognition task, and a task that assessed the tendency to over-claim one's knowledge. Signal detection analyses showed that higher intellectual humility was associated with higher discriminability between old and new items, regardless of whether the items were congruent or incongruent with participants' own beliefs. However, intellectual humility was not related to response bias, indicating that intellectually arrogant people were not biased to claim that they knew everything. Together, the findings support a relationship between intellectual humility and performance on memory tasks, indicating that individual differences in intellectual humility may partly reflect how people process information and judge what they do and do not know.},

Considerable research studies are carried out in order to apprehend how effective and usable e-learning systems. In this paper, an empirical-based study is conducted to explore how lecturers interact with an e-learning environment based on a predefined task model describing low-level interactions. Client-side log data is collected from university lecturers from the Electrical and Computer Science departments. Subsequently, data analysis is conducted to infer the usability degree from the estimated usage metrics together with further exploratory analysis from user feedback via System Usability Scale. Experimental results reveal that the System Usability Scale score is not a sufficient measure to express the true acceptance and satisfaction level of lecturers for using the e-learning systems. The evaluation must be fulfilled in tandem with analyzing the usage metrics derived from interaction traces in a non-intrusive fashion. The proposed approach is a milestone towards usability evaluation to improve the acceptance and user experience for academic staff and students.},

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of recently trained paediatricians which included a validated 23-item instrument called the Test of Residents’ Ethics Knowledge for Pediatrics. The sample included paediatricians who completed medical school in 2006–2008, whose primary specialty was paediatrics or a paediatric subspecialty, and who completed paediatric residency training in 2010–2011. This sample was stratified based on residency programme variables: presence of a formal curriculum in ethics or professionalism, programme size and American Board of Pediatrics certifying exam passage rate. Paediatricians were randomly selected from each stratum for survey participation. Results Among the 370 responding paediatricians (55\%), the mean knowledge score was 17.3 (SD 2.2) out of a possible 23. Presence of a formal curriculum in ethics and/or professionalism was not significantly associated with knowledge. Knowledge was lowest on items about parental requests for a child to undergo genetic testing (2 items, 44\% and 85\% incorrect), preserving patient confidentiality over email (55\% incorrect), decision-making regarding life-sustaining technologies (61\% incorrect), and decision-making principles such as assent and parental permission (2 items, 47\% and 49\% incorrect). Conclusions This study highlights several areas in which paediatricians’ knowledge may be low and that are amenable to targeted educational interventions. These findings should prompt discussion and research among ethicists and educators about how ethics and professionalism curricula can more consistently influence paediatricians’ knowledge.},

For the empirical study, data were obtained from 105 university students who were enrolled in two blended learning courses that used AOD as their main activity. The results indicated the high accuracy of the prediction model as well as the possibility of early detection and timely interventions. In addition, we examined participants' learning behaviors in the two courses using the proxy variables and provided suggestions for practice.

  abstract = {Methods: In a cross-sectional design, the Self-Regulation of Learning Self-Report Scale (SRL-SRS) was used to investigate the change in students’ self-regulated learning skills. First and third-year students (N ¼ 949, 81.7\%) SRL-SRS scores were compared with ANOVA. The relation with academic performance was investigated with multinomial regression analysis. Results: Only one of the six skills, reflection, significantly, but positively, changed during medical school. In addition, a small, but positive relation of monitoring, reflection, and effort with first-year GPA was found, while only effort was related to third-year GPA. Conclusions: The change in self-regulated learning skills is minor as only the level of reflection differs between the first and third year. In addition, the relation between self-regulated learning skills and academic performance is limited. Medical schools are therefore encouraged to re-examine the curriculum and methods they use to enhance their students’ self-regulated learning skills. Future research is required to understand the limited impact on performance.},

  abstract = {Objective: To develop an evidence-based guideline for Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) for systematic reviews (SRs), health technology assessments, and other evidence syntheses. Study Design and Setting: An SR, Web-based survey of experts, and consensus development forum were undertaken to identify checklists that evaluated or validated electronic literature search strategies and to determine which of their elements related to search quality or errors. Results: Systematic review: No new search elements were identified for addition to the existing (2008e2010) PRESS 2015 EvidenceBased Checklist, and there was no evidence refuting any of its elements. Results suggested that structured PRESS could identify search errors and improve the selection of search terms. Web-based survey of experts: Most respondents felt that peer review should be undertaken after the MEDLINE search had been prepared but before it had been translated to other databases. Consensus development forum: Of the seven original PRESS elements, six were retained: translation of the research question; Boolean and proximity operators; subject headings; text word search; spelling, syntax and line numbers; and limits and filters. The seventh (skilled translation of the search strategy to additional databases) was removed, as there was consensus that this should be left to the discretion of searchers. An updated PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement was developed, which includes the following four documents: PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, PRESS 2015 Recommendations for Librarian Practice, PRESS 2015 Implementation Strategies, and PRESS 2015 Guideline Assessment Form. Conclusion: The PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement should help to guide and improve the peer review of electronic literature search strategies. Ó 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The authors examine the challenges students faced in trying to write organized texts using effective thesis statements and topic sentences by analyzing argumentative history essays written by multilingual students enrolled in an undergraduate history course. They use the notions of macro‐Theme (i.e., thesis statement) and hyper‐Theme (i.e., topic sentence) from systemic functional linguistics to categorize students' challenges constructing effective macro‐Themes and hyper‐Themes. They compare higher graded essays and lower graded essays at six time points during one semester. Both higher and lower graded essays showed challenges with the fronting, specificity, and consistency of their macro‐Themes and hyper‐Themes. However, there was improvement over the course of the semester. By identifying these challenges, the authors aim to help teachers and students develop a meta‐language to talk about these textual features of academic writing and thus enhance the teaching and writing of academic writing. They call for the need for explicit instruction to enhance students' organization of their ideas.},

The aim of this study was to examine the validity of early diagnosis of struggling in medical school based on informal teacher judgements of in-class behavior. The study design was a prospective cohort study and the outcomes/truth criteria were anatomy failure and medical school drop out. Six weeks into an anatomy course, student tutors attempted to identify medical students, who they reckoned would fail the anatomy course or drop out, based on their everyday experiences with students in a large group educational setting. In addition, they were asked to describe the indicators of struggling they observed. Sixteen student tutors evaluated 429 medical students for signs of struggling. By week six, the student tutors were able to detect approximately 1/4–1/3 of the students who eventually failed or dropped out, and for ¾ of the strugglers they identified, they were correct in their judgments. Informal student tutor’s judgements showed incremental validity for both outcomes when controlling for grades obtained in preceeding exams. Lack of participation, lack of commitment, poor academic performance, poor social interactions and general signs of distress were the main indicators of struggling identified. Teachers’ informal judgements of in-class behavior may be an untapped source of information in the early identification of struggling medical students with added value above and beyond formal testing.},

Consequently, the influence of the clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students’ intrinsic motivation. The aim of this study was to describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. Methods: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. Findings: Several themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and constructive feedback; delivery of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. Conclusions: Our findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomysupportive style to motivate their patients.},

  abstract = {Statement: Debriefing is a critical component in the process of learning through healthcare simulation. This critical review examines the timing, facilitation, conversational structures, and process elements used in healthcare simulation debriefing. Debriefing occurs either after (postevent) or during (within-event) the simulation. The debriefing conversation can be guided by either a facilitator (facilitator-guided) or the simulation participants themselves (self-guided). Postevent facilitator-guided debriefing may incorporate several conversational structures. These conversational structures break the debriefing discussion into a series of 3 or more phases to help organize the debriefing and ensure the conversation proceeds in an orderly manner. Debriefing process elements are an array of techniques to optimize reflective experience and maximize the impact of debriefing. These are divided here into the following 3 categories: essential elements, conversational techniques/educational strategies, and debriefing adjuncts. This review provides both novice and advanced simulation educators with an overview of various methods of conducting healthcare simulation debriefing. Future research will investigate which debriefing methods are best for which contexts and for whom, and also explore how lessons from simulation debriefing translate to debriefing in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Problem: Many medical schools are modifying curricula to reflect the rapidly evolving health care environment, but schools struggle to provide the educational informatics technology (IT) support to make the necessary changes. Often a medical school’s IT support for the education mission derives from isolated work units employing separate technologies that are not interoperable. Intervention: We launched a redesigned, tightly integrated, and novel IT infrastructure to support a completely revamped curriculum at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. This system uses coordinated and interoperable technologies to support new instructional methods, capture students’ effort, and manage feedback, allowing the monitoring of students’ progress toward specific competency goals across settings and programs. Context: The new undergraduate medical education program at Vanderbilt, entitled Curriculum 2.0, is a competency-based curriculum in which the ultimate goal is medical student advancement based on performance outcomes and personal goals rather than a time-based sequence of courses. IT support was essential in the creation of Curriculum 2.0. In addition to typical learning and curriculum management functions, IT was needed to capture data in the learning workflow for analysis, as well as for informing individual and programmatic success. We aligned people, processes, and technology to provide the IT infrastructure for the organizational transformation. Outcomes: Educational IT personnel were successfully realigned to create the new IT system. The IT infrastructure enabled monitoring of student performance within each competency domain across settings and time via personal student electronic portfolios. Students use aggregated performance data, derived in real time from the portfolio, for mentor-guided performance assessment, and for creation of individual learning goals and plans. Poorly performing students were identified earlier through online communication systems that alert the appropriate instructor or coach of low quiz grades or missed learning goals. Graphical and narrative displays of a student’s competency performance across courses and clinical experiences informed high-stake decisions made about student progress by the promotions committee. Similarly, graphical display of aggregate student outcomes provided education leaders with information needed to adjust and improve the curriculum. Lessons Learned: With the alignment of people, processes, and technology, educational IT can facilitate transformational steps in the training of medical students.},

  abstract = {Background: This review, which focused on faculty development initiatives designed to improve teaching effectiveness, synthesized findings related to intervention types, study characteristics, individual and organizational outcomes, key features, and community building. Methods: This review included 111 studies (between 2002 and 2012) that met the review criteria. Findings: Overall satisfaction with faculty development programs was high. Participants reported increased confidence, enthusiasm, and awareness of effective educational practices. Gains in knowledge and skills, and self-reported changes in teaching behaviors, were frequently noted. Observed behavior changes included enhanced teaching practices, new educational initiatives, new leadership positions, and increased academic output. Organizational changes were infrequently explored. Key features included evidence-informed educational design, relevant content, experiential learning, feedback and reflection, educational projects, intentional community building, longitudinal program design, and institutional support. Conclusion: This review holds implications for practice and research. Moving forward, we should build on current success, broaden the focus beyond individual teaching effectiveness, develop programs that extend over time, promote workplace learning, foster community development, and secure institutional support. We should also embed studies in a theoretical framework, conduct more qualitative and mixed methods studies, assess behavioral and organizational change, evaluate transfer to practice, analyse key features, and explore the role of faculty development within the larger organizational context.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Exams, tight deadlines and interpersonal conflicts are just a few examples of the many events that may result in high levels of stress in both students and teachers. Research over the past two decades identified stress and the hormones and neurotransmitters released during and after a stressful event as major modulators of human learning and memory processes, with critical implications for educational contexts. While stress around the time of learning is thought to enhance memory formation, thus leading to robust memories, stress markedly impairs memory retrieval, bearing, for instance, the risk of underachieving at exams. Recent evidence further indicates that stress may hamper the updating of memories in the light of new information and induce a shift from a flexible, ‘cognitive’ form of learning towards rather rigid, ‘habit’-like behaviour. Together, these stress-induced changes may explain some of the difficulties of learning and remembering under stress in the classroom. Taking these insights from psychology and neuroscience into account could bear the potential to facilitate processes of education for both students and teachers.},

E-learning systems allow learning anytime and anywhere. This medium may seem to be the answer to all learning barriers, but the effect of non-cognitive skills on the success of e-learning systems is yet to be explored. Latest studies demonstrate that students with high grit levels, stamina in pursuing long term objectives, achieve better results in learning. In our study we propose a theoretical model studying grit as a determinant of e-learning systems success. The study was conducted on a sample of university students' sample, and a theoretical model was validated using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicate that grit has positive effects on satisfaction and in students' individual performance. The results help to improve e-learning strategies and to understand e-learning success, explained by students’ skills and systems characteristics.},

Seeing that attempts to resolve these challenges are fragmented across the literature, a systematic review was performed. Starting from 640 sources, 20 studies on the design of blended learning environments were selected through a staged procedure based on the guidelines of the PRISMA statement, using predefined selection criteria. For each study, the instructional activities for dealing with these four challenges were analyzed by two coders. The results show that few studies offer learners control over the realization of the blend. Social interaction is generally stimulated through introductory face-to-face meetings, while personalization and monitoring of students’ learning progress is commonly organized through online instructional activities. Finally, little attention is paid to instructional activities that foster an affective learning climate.},

Methods: Fifteen purposefully selected researchers in medical education were asked to nominate papers they considered influential in medical education. Through this process 41 papers were identified and included in the study. Results: The papers were analysed with thematic content analysis, which resulted in three approaches to the use of theory: as close-up exploration; as a specific perspective; and as an overview. The approaches are exemplified by quotes from the papers included in our dataset and further illuminated by a metaphoric story. Conclusions: We conclude by pointing at the importance of making explicit how theory is used in medical education as a way to collaboratively take responsibility for the quality of medical education research.},

  abstract = {Understanding by Design is a book written by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe that offers a framework for designing courses and content units called “Backward Design.” Instructors typically approach course design in a “forward design” manner, meaning they consider the learning activities (how to teach the content), develop assessments around their learning activities, then attempt to draw connections to the learning goals of the course. In contrast, the backward design approach has instructors consider the learning goals of the course first. These learning goals embody the knowledge and skills instructors want their students to have learned when they leave the course. Once the learning goals have been established, the second stage involves consideration of assessment. The backward design framework suggests that instructors should consider these overarching learning goals and how students will be assessed prior to consideration of how to teach the content. For this reason, backward design is considered a much more intentional approach to course design than traditional methods of design. This teaching guide will explain the benefits of incorporating backward design. Then it will elaborate on the three stages that backward design encompasses. Finally, an overview of a backward design template is provided with links to blank template pages for convenience.},

Nurses and midwives often have clinical questions suitable to a qualitative approach but little time to develop an exhaustive comprehension of qualitative methodological approaches. Qualitative description research is sometimes considered a less sophisticated approach for epistemological reasons. Another challenge when considering qualitative description design is differentiating qualitative description from other qualitative approaches. This article provides a systematic and robust journey through the philosophical, ontological, and epistemological perspectives, which evidences the purpose of qualitative description research. Methods and rigor issues underpinning qualitative description research are also appraised to provide the researcher with a systematic approach to conduct research utilizing this approach. The key attributes and value of qualitative description research in the health care professions will be highlighted with the aim of extending its usage.},

  abstract = {Medical education is under increasing pressure to more effectively prepare physicians to meet the needs of patients and populations. With its emphasis on individual, programmatic, and institutional outcomes, competency-based medical education (CBME) has the potential to realign medical education with this societal expectation. Implementing CBME, however, comes with significant challenges. This manuscript describes four overarching challenges that must be confronted by medical educators worldwide in the implementation of CBME: (1) the need to align all regulatory stakeholders in order to facilitate the optimization of training programs and learning environments so that they support competency-based progression; (2) the purposeful integration of efforts to redesign both medical education and the delivery of clinical care; (3) the need to establish expected outcomes for individuals, programs, training institutions, and health care systems so that performance can be measured; and (4) the need to establish a culture of mutual accountability for the achievement of these defined outcomes. In overcoming these challenges, medical educators, leaders, and policy-makers will need to seek collaborative approaches to common problems and to learn from innovators who have already successfully made the transition to CBME.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-regulated learning is the individual’s ability to effectively use various strategies to reach their learning goals. We conducted this scoping review to explore what has been found regarding self-regulated learning in the clinical environment and how this was measured. Methods: Using Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework, we searched three medical and educational databases as well as Google Scholar for literature on the self-regulated learning of medical students in the clinical environment published between 1966 and February 2017. After results were screened and relevant studies were identified, the data was summarised and discursively reported. Results: The search resulted in 911 articles, with 14 articles included in the scoping review after the inclusion criteria was applied. Self-regulated learning was explored in these studies in various ways including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. Three major findings were found: 1) levels of self-regulated learning change in the clinical environment, 2) self-regulated learning is associated with academic achievement, success in clinical skills and mental health and 3) various factors can support self-regulated learning levels in medical students. Conclusions: Most of articles exploring the self-regulated learning of medical students during the clinical years have been published in the last 5 years, suggesting a growing interest in the area. Future research could explore the self-regulated learning levels of medical students during the clinical years using a longitudinal approach or through the use of novel qualitative approaches.},

With the growing popularity of gamification and yet mixed success of its application in educational contexts, the current review is aiming to shed a more realistic light on the research in this field by focusing on empirical evidence rather than on potentialities, beliefs or preferences. Accordingly, it critically examines the advancement in gamifying education. The discussion is structured around the used gamification mechanisms, the gamified subjects, the type of gamified learning activities, and the study goals, with an emphasis on the reliability and validity of the reported outcomes. To improve our understanding and offer a more realistic picture of the progress of gamification in education, consistent with the presented evidence, we examine both the outcomes reported in the papers and how they have been obtained. While the gamification in education is still a growing phenomenon, the review reveals that (i) insufficient evidence exists to support the long-term benefits of gamification in educational contexts; (ii) the practice of gamifying learning has outpaced researchers’ understanding of its mechanisms and methods; (iii) the knowledge of how to gamify an activity in accordance with the specifics of the educational context is still limited. The review highlights the need for systematically designed studies and rigorously tested approaches confirming the educational benefits of gamification, if gamified learning is to become a recognized instructional approach.},

In such a scenario, it makes sense to focus on the most identifiable and urgent problems, right? Actually, it doesn't. In his classic essay "The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge," Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the man who helped bring Albert Einstein to the United States, describes a great paradox of scientific research. The search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications, often leads not only to the greatest scientific discoveries but also to the most revolutionary technological breakthroughs. In short, no quantum mechanics, no computer chips. This brief book includes Flexner's timeless 1939 essay alongside a new companion essay by Robbert Dijkgraaf, the Institute's current director, in which he shows that Flexner's defense of the value of "the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge" may be even more relevant today than it was in the early twentieth century. Dijkgraaf describes how basic research has led to major transformations in the past century and explains why it is an essential precondition of innovation and the first step in social and cultural change.--},

In this article, we aimed to identify and summarize key papers that would be helpful for faculty members interested in learning more about study design in medical education research. Methods: The online discussions of the 2016-2017 Academic Life in Emergency Medicine Faculty Incubator program included a robust and vigorous discussion about education study design, which highlighted a number of papers on that topic. We augmented this list of papers with further suggestions by expert mentors. Via this process, we created a list of 29 papers in total on the topic of medical education study design. After gathering these papers, our authorship group engaged in a modified Delphi approach to build consensus on the papers that were most valuable for the understanding of proper study design in medical education. Results: We selected the top five most highly rated papers on the topic domain of study design as determined by our study group. We subsequently summarized these papers with respect to their relevance to junior faculty members and to faculty developers. Conclusion: This article summarizes five key papers addressing study design in medical education with discussions and applications for junior faculty members and faculty developers. These papers provide a basis upon which junior faculty members might build for developing and analyzing studies. [West J Emerg Med. 2017;18(4)705-712.]},

  abstract = {Introduction: Many teachers adopt instructional methods based on assumptions of best practices without attention to or knowledge of supporting education theory. Familiarity with a variety of theories informs education that is efficient, strategic, and evidence-based. As part of the Academic Life in Emergency Medicine Faculty Incubator Program, a list of key education theories for junior faculty was developed. Methods: A list of key papers on theories relevant to medical education was generated using an expert panel, a virtual community of practice synthetic discussion, and a social media call for resources. A threeround, Delphi-informed voting methodology including novice and expert educators produced a rank order of the top papers. Results: These educators identified 34 unique papers. Eleven papers described the general use of education theory, while 23 papers focused on a specific theory. The top three papers on general education theories and top five papers on specific education theory were selected and summarized. The relevance of each paper for junior faculty and faculty developers is also presented. Conclusion: This paper presents a reading list of key papers for junior faculty in medical education roles. Three papers about general education theories and five papers about specific educational theories are identified and annotated. These papers may help provide foundational knowledge in education theory to inform junior faculty teaching practice. [West J Emerg Med. 2017;18(2)293-302.]},

RESULTS: 17.7\% of all students required some form of remedial assistance and 93\% of all students o ered remediation passed their year of study. Multivariate analysis showed international students (OR 4.59 95\% CI 2.62–7.98) and students admitted via the Māori and Pacific Admission Scheme (OR 3.43 2.29–5.15) were significantly more likely to require remediation. Male students were also slightly more likely than their female classmates to require assistance. No e ect was observed for rural origin students, completion of a prior degree or completion of clinical placement in a peripheral hospital. Knowledge application and information synthesis were the most frequently identified underlying problems. Most faculty believed remediation was successful, however, flexibility in the programme structure, improved diagnostics and improved access to dedicated teaching sta were cited as areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Remediation is required by nearly a fi h of University of Auckland medical students, with MAPAS and international students being particularly vulnerable groups. Remediation is largely successful, however, interventions addressing reasoning and knowledge application may improve its e ectiveness.},

  abstract = {Interdisciplinary approaches are sought in academia as a means to help resolve aspects of unsustainability. In management education, one of many challenges that relate to interdisciplinary working is the development and reinforcement of disciplinary working in teaching sessions. Indeed, perspectives on sustainable development from different disciplines can be brought into teaching activities and presented to students. However, taking different perspectives into education require students to be actively engaged. Drawing on the novel approach known as gamification, this paper explores how it can be used to elevate students’ engagement in management education for sustainable development. Gamification is a broad concept, which has been used in multiple settings such as marketing to promote actor engagement. Using case study research, a case was developed to illustrate the use of gamification in an education management context. Findings show how gamification can be used in teaching to increase motivation and engagement among students. The paper concludes that gamification may offer a pedagogic approach to elevate students’ engagement in management education for sustainable development and to promote multi-disciplinary working.},

  abstract = {Research on the effectiveness of gamification has proliferated over the last few years, but the underlying motivational mechanisms have only recently become object of empirical research. It has been suggested that when perceived as informational, gamification elements, such as points, levels and leaderboards, may afford feelings of competence and hence enhance intrinsic motivation and promote performance gains. We conducted a 2 Â 4 online experiment that systematically examined how points, leaderboards and levels, as well as participants' goal causality orientation influence intrinsic motivation, competence and performance (tag quantity and quality) in an image annotation task. Compared to a control condition, game elements did not significantly affect competence or intrinsic motivation, irrespective of participants' causality orientation. However, participants' performance did not mirror their intrinsic motivation, as points, and especially levels and leaderboard led to a significantly higher amount of tags generated compared to the control group. These findings suggest that in this particular study context, points, levels and leaderboards functioned as extrinsic incentives, effective only for promoting performance quantity.},

  abstract = {While carrying out formative assessment activities over social network services (SNS), it has been noted that personalized notifications have a high chance of “the important post getting lost” in the notification feed. In order to highlight this problem, this paper compares within a posttest only quasi-experiment, a total of 104 first year undergraduate students, all of which are prospective ICT teachers, in two groups. A formative assessment system in the ubiquitous learning context is delivered over an SNS in both groups. In the first group, the SNS has been used for the entire assessment task. In the second group, the questions have been delivered and responses were received over mobile phone “SMS” messages, while the SNS was used solely for providing feedback. The cases were compared in terms of voluntary participation rates and academic success. Both response rates and academic success have been significantly higher in the SMS group. When asked their reasons for not responding to questions; the SNSonly group frequently reported “not noticing the questions being sent”. This may indicate a flaw in message design for using social networks as LMS's. Sensible use of push-messages is advised.},

The overall conclusions of a meta-analysis, however, depend heavily on the quality of the meta-analytic process, and an appropriate evaluation of the quality of metaanalysis (meta-evaluation) can be challenging. We outline ten questions biologists can ask to critically appraise a meta-analysis. These questions could also act as simple and accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus on meta-analyses using nonhuman species, which we term ‘biological’ metaanalysis. Our ten questions are aimed at enabling a biologist to evaluate whether a biological meta-analysis embodies ‘mega-enlightenment’, a ‘mega-mistake’, or something in between.},

In FC applications, students are first exposed to content via online resources. Subsequent face-to-face class time can then be devoted to student-centered activities that promote active learning. Although the FC has been well received by students in other contexts, the perceptions of medical students regarding this innovation are unclear. This review serves as an early exploration into medical student perceptions of benefits and limitations of the FC. Medical students have generally expressed strong appreciation for the pre-class preparation activities (especially when facilitated by concise, readily accessed online tools) as well as for interactive, engaging small group classroom activities. Some students have expressed concerns with the FC and noted that suboptimal student preparation and insufficient direction and structure during active learning sessions may limit the student-centered benefits. Although students generally perceive that FC approaches can improve their learning and knowledge, this has not been conclusively shown via performances on assessment tools, which may be related to caveats with the assessment tools used. In any case, lifelong self-directed learning skills are perceived by medical students to be enhanced by the FC. In conclusion, medical students have generally expressed strong satisfaction with early applications of the FC to undergraduate medical education, and generally prefer this method to lecture-based instruction.},

According to a 2014 report by the Educause Center for Analysis and Research, 99\% of higher education institutions have an LMS in place, and the LMS is used by 85\% of faculty and 83\% of students. This was not always the case, however. There was a time in the not-so-distant past when using an LMS was considered highly innovative. Understanding the growth and adoption of the LMS is a stepping stone to understanding how faculty may choose to adopt other technological and pedagogical innovations. This study was conducted at a large, research-intensive public university in the Midwest, which has used the same LMS for 15 years. From a small pilot, adoption has grown to nearly universal use. This study used system logs and database queries to examine how faculty used the LMS. The results identified the features that were used most frequently and how usage had changed over time. In addition, the study compared the usage data for face-to-face and online courses to determine if there are differences in LMS use due to course modality. Based on this, it is possible to better understand the role the LMS plays in higher education and online learning, to inform development of next generation learning systems or other innovative technologies.},

  abstract = {Background: Existing theories of self-directed learning (SDL) have emphasized the importance of process, personal, and contextual factors. Previous medical education research has largely focused on the process of SDL. We explored the experience with and perception of SDL among internal medicine residents to gain understanding of the personal and contextual factors of SDL in graduate medical education. Methods: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we conducted 7 focus group interviews with 46 internal medicine residents at an academic medical center. We processed the data by using open coding and writing analytic memos. Team members organized open codes to create axial codes, which were applied to all transcripts. Guided by a previous model of SDL, we developed a theoretical model that was revised through constant comparison with new data as they were collected, and we refined the theory until it had adequate explanatory power and was appropriately grounded in the experiences of residents. Results: We developed a theoretical model of SDL to explain the process, personal, and contextual factors affecting SDL during residency training. The process of SDL began with a trigger that uncovered a knowledge gap. Residents progressed to formulating learning objectives, using resources, applying knowledge, and evaluating learning. Personal factors included motivations, individual characteristics, and the change in approach to SDL over time. Contextual factors included the need for external guidance, the influence of residency program structure and culture, and the presence of contextual barriers. Conclusions: We developed a theoretical model of SDL in medical education that can be used to promote and assess resident SDL through understanding the process, person, and context of SDL.},

Organizations that create environments in which trust and cooperation thrive vastly out perform their competition. And, not coincidentally, their employees love working there. But "truly human" cultures don't just happen; they are intentionally created by great leaders. Leaders who, in hard times, would sooner sacrifice their numbers to protect their people, rather than sacrifice people to protect their numbers, are rewarded with deeply loyal teams that consistently contribute their best efforts, ideas and passion. As he did in Start With Why, Sinek illustrates his points with fascinating true stories from many fields. He implores us to act sooner rather than later, because our stressful jobs are literally killing us. And he offers surprisingly simple steps for building a truly human organization"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Not all students cope successfully with the demands of medical school, and students’ struggles may result in study delay or dropout. To prevent these outcomes, medical schools need to identify students who are experiencing academic difficul ties and provide them with timely interventions through access to support programs. Although the importance of early identification and intervention is well recognized, less is known about successful strategies for identifying and supporting struggling students.             Building on the literature and their own empirical findings, the authors propose an integrated, school-wide model for medical student success comprising a continuum of academic and behavioral support. This Four-Tier Continuum of Academic and Behavioral Support (4T-CABS) model focuses on improving both academic and behavioral outcomes by offering support for students at four levels, which range from adequate instruction for all, to targeted small-group interventions, to individualized support, and also include exit support for students who might be better off in another degree program. Additionally, medical schools should provide both academic and behavioral support; set high, yet realistic expectations and clearly communicate these to students; and intervene early, which requires timely identification of at-risk students who would benefit from the different types and tiers of support. Finally, interventions should be evidence based and fit the needs of the identified groups of students. The authors argue that adopting the core principles of the 4T-CABS model will enable medical schools to maximize academic engagement and performance for all students.},

  abstract = {Background: There is little evidence regarding the comparative quality of abstracts and articles in medical education research. The Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI), which was developed to evaluate the quality of reporting in medical education, has strong validity evidence for content, internal structure, and relationships to other variables. We used the MERSQI to compare the quality of reporting for conference abstracts, journal abstracts, and published articles. Methods: This is a retrospective study of all 46 medical education research abstracts submitted to the Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 Annual Meeting that were subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal. We compared MERSQI scores of the abstracts with scores for their corresponding published journal abstracts and articles. Comparisons were performed using the signed rank test. Results: Overall MERSQI scores increased significantly for published articles compared with conference abstracts (11.33 vs 9.67; P {$<$} .001) and journal abstracts (11.33 vs 9.96; P {$<$} .001). Regarding MERSQI subscales, published articles had higher MERSQI scores than conference abstracts in the domains of sampling (1.59 vs 1.34; P = .006), data analysis (3.00 vs 2.43; P {$<$} .001), and validity of evaluation instrument (1.04 vs 0.28; P {$<$} .001). Published articles also had higher MERSQI scores than journal abstracts in the domains of data analysis (3.00 vs 2.70; P = .004) and validity of evaluation instrument (1.04 vs 0.26; P {$<$} .001). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the quality of medical education abstracts and journal articles using the MERSQI. Overall, the quality of articles was greater than that of abstracts. However, there were no significant differences between abstracts and articles for the domains of study design and outcomes, which indicates that these MERSQI elements may be applicable to abstracts. Findings also suggest that abstract quality is generally preserved from original presentation to publication.},

METHODS We discuss the methodological origins of these terms and the applications supported by these origins. We reflect critically on how these four terms became expected of qualitative research in HPE, and we reconsider their meanings and use by drawing on the broader qualitative methodology literature. CONCLUSIONS Through this examination, we hope to encourage qualitative scholars in HPE to avoid using qualitative terms uncritically and non-reflexively.},

In particular, it contributes to the limited knowledge bases on the effectiveness of e-learning in Saudi Arabia, and on the differences in perspectives of different groups of stakeholders in e-learning. Based on previous research, a questionnaire was designed and distributed to convenience samples of academic staff and students at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. Respondents were invited to express their opinion regarding the importance of a number of factors to the success of e-learning. Principal Component Analysis was conducted on each dataset, in turn, to assess the loading of items onto factors, and the variance explained. The most important finding from this study is that the perspectives of students and academic staff differ, with there being nine factors for academic staff and seven for students. Categories that are common to both groups are: student characteristics, instructor characteristics, ease of access, and support and training. The order for academics is: student characteristics, ease of access, instructor characteristics, and support and training; and, the order for students is: instructor characteristics, student characteristics, support and training, and ease of access.},

Usage of e-lecture and learning behaviors were evaluated for their associations with learning outcomes. Methods: This questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study enrolled 107 first pre-clinical year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand. Information on learning outcomes of biomedical subjects and learning behavior including e-lecture use, self-study time, skipping class and inattention were collected. Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: Compared to students who earned average biomedical grades of {$>$}3.0, students who earned average grades ≤3.0 significantly used more e-lecture (median, IQR 63.81, 49.17-70.03 and 31.08, 11.29-51.49, respectively, p =0.001), had more inattention time during lectures (median, IQR, 22.13, 14.94-31.19, and 13.1, 8.05-20.30, respectively, p=0.008), and spent less time for self-study and review of lessons (median, IQR 102.00, 68.00-176.50, and 147.50, 106.25-246.00, respectively, p=0.04). For each one hour increase in e-lecture usage, the chance of earning an average biomedical grade of {$>$}3.0 was decreased by 4\%. Positive correlations were found between e-lecture usage with skipping class and with inattention during lecture (coefficients = 0.31 and 0.37, with p=0.001 and p{$<$}0.001, respectively). Time spent for self-study and review of lessons negatively correlated with inattention during lectures (coefficient =-0.28, p=0.003). Conclusion: E-lecture may be misused by students who have poor learning behaviors as a substitute for in-class lectures. Time voluntarily spent in e-lecture may be an indicator for students who need educational guidance and/ or counseling.},

The Bullet Journal Method is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls "intentional living": weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure.

  abstract = {CONTEXT The flipped classroom (FC), reversing lecture and homework elements of a course, is popular in medical education. The FC uses technology-enhanced pre-class learning to transmit knowledge, incorporating in-class interaction to enhance higher cognitive learning. However, the FC model is expensive and research on its effectiveness remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the FC model over traditional lecture-based (LB) learning by meta-analysis. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, EMBASE, reference lists and Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) conference books. Controlled trials comparing academic outcomes between the FC and LB approaches in higher education were considered eligible. The main findings were pooled using a random-effects model when appropriate. RESULTS Forty-six studies (9026 participants) were included, comprising four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 19 quasi-experimental studies and 23 cohort studies. Study populations were health science (n = 32) and non health science (n = 14) students. The risk of bias was high (36/37 articles). Meta-analyses revealed that the FC had significantly better outcomes than the LB method in examination scores (post-intervention and pre-post change) and course grades, but not in objective structured clinical examination scores. Subgroup analyses showed the advantage of the FC was not observed in RCTs, non-USA countries, nursing and other health science disciplines and earlier publication years (2013 and 2014). Cumulative analysis and meta-regression suggested a tendency for progressively better outcomes by year. Outcome assessments rarely focused on behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS The FC method is associated with greater academic achievement than the LB approach for higher-level learning outcomes, which has become more obvious in recent years. However, results should be interpreted with caution because of the high methodological diversity, statistical heterogeneity and risk of bias in the studies used. Future studies should have high methodological rigour, a standardised FC format and utilise assessment tools evaluating higher cognitive learning and behaviour change to further examine differences between FC and LB learning.},

  abstract = {Background: Student failure creates additional economic costs. Knowing the cost of failure helps to frame its economic burden relative to other educational issues, providing an evidence-base to guide priority setting and allocation of resources. The Ingredients Method is a cost-analysis approach which has been previously applied to health professions education research. In this study, the Ingredients Method is introduced, and applied to a case study, investigating the cost of pre-clinical student failure. Methods: The four step Ingredients Method was introduced and applied: (1) identify and specify resource items, (2) measure volume of resources in natural units, (3) assign monetary prices to resource items, and (4) analyze and report costs. Calculations were based on a physiotherapy program at an Australian university. Results: The cost of failure was £5991 per failing student, distributed across students (70\%), the government (21\%), and the university (8\%). If the cost of failure and attrition is distributed among the remaining continuing cohort, the cost per continuing student educated increases from £9923 to £11,391 per semester. Conclusions: The economics of health professions education is complex. Researchers should consider both accuracy and feasibility in their costing approach, toward the goal of better informing cost-conscious decision-making.},

  abstract = {Checklists can mitigate a multitude of high-cost mistakes in fields ranging from surgery to aviation. As part of a standard protocol, checklists may provide many benefits, including improved equity and communication among team members and more efficient integration of different processes during complex tasks. Mostly, though, checklists serve as easy, efficient means to remind professionals of what they already know but can easily forget. By improving processes, checklists can reduce procedural errors, miscommunications, and even deaths. Although the stakes of writing a survey are rarely as high as they are for performing surgery or piloting a plane, checklists can improve the quality of surveys in medical education. In this Perspective, the authors propose a survey checklist to serve the same core function as surgical checklists—to reduce error. That is, a survey checklist can help medical education practitioners and researchers gather more accurate responses. Designers can use the checklist in the appendix to guide item creation processes or to help evaluate the quality of existing surveys. The checklist focuses on formulating items, crafting response options, and formatting/organizing the whole survey.},

After attending a presentation by the first author on the FC, a faculty member of a medical school in Mexico arranged for a 3-day workshop for 13 faculty members. The goal of the workshop was to train faculty to use the FC strategy in their classrooms to increase student engagement in learning. The workshop was in the FC style, where the participants would assume the role of students. Pre- and posttraining surveys were administered to examine participants' current teaching practices and to evaluate their perceptions of the FC. The participants overwhelmingly reported the need to change their lecture-based teaching, as it was not engaging students. Their large class size, lack of technology, training, and uncertainty of the effectiveness of new teaching methods had hindered participants from changing their teaching technique. The on-site training not only allowed the entire department to work closely and discuss the new teaching approach, but also reinforced the idea of changing their teaching strategy and embracing FC teaching method. After the workshop, participants reported being determined to use the FC strategy in their classrooms and felt more prepared to do so. The post-survey results indicated that participants valued the FC training in the flipped style and wanted more of the hands-on activities. In conclusion, the 3-day faculty workshop on the FC was successful, since every participant was motivated to use this teaching method.},

Methods: A systematic review was made by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers following the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines. We included peer-reviewed journal articles which described or assessed the use of serious games or gamified apps in medical education. We used the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to assess the quality of evidence in the use of games. We also evaluated the pedagogical perspectives of such articles.},

  abstract = {Several challenges are associated with e-learning systems, the most significant of which is the lack of student motivation in various course activities and for various course materials. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify low-engagement students in a social science course at the Open University (OU) to assess the effect of engagement on student performance. The input variables of the study included               highest education level               ,               final results               ,               score on the assessment               , and the number of clicks on virtual learning environment (VLE) activities, which included               dataplus               ,               forumng               ,               glossary               ,               oucollaborate               ,               oucontent               ,               resources               ,               subpages               ,               homepage               ,               and URL               during the first course assessment. The output variable was the student level of engagement in the various activities. To predict low-engagement students, we applied several ML algorithms to the dataset. Using these algorithms, trained models were first obtained; then, the accuracy and kappa values of the models were compared. The results demonstrated that the J48, decision tree, JRIP, and gradient-boosted classifiers exhibited better performance in terms of the accuracy, kappa value, and recall compared to the other tested models. Based on these findings, we developed a dashboard to facilitate instructor at the OU. These models can easily be incorporated into VLE systems to help instructors evaluate student engagement during VLE courses with regard to different activities and materials and to provide additional interventions for students in advance of their final exam. Furthermore, this study examined the relationship between student engagement and the course assessment score.},

As more institutions continue to consider the change from the traditional five‐tier letter grading system (A/B/C/D/F) to a two‐tier grading system (pass/fail), this debate will likely continue. This point/counterpoint article examines arguments for and against each type of grading system, taking into consideration academic performance, learning outcomes, psychological well‐being, learning environment, acceptance/performance in postgraduate educational programs, and student motivation.

  abstract = {Research in psychology has shown that both motivation and wellbeing are contingent on the satisfaction of certain psychological needs. Yet, despite a long-standing pursuit in human-computer interaction (HCI) for design strategies that foster sustained engagement, behavior change and wellbeing, the basic psychological needs shown to mediate these outcomes are rarely taken into account. This is possibly due to the lack of a clear model to explain these needs in the context of HCI. Herein we introduce such a model: Motivation, Engagement and Thriving in User Experience (METUX). The model provides a framework grounded in psychological research that can allow HCI researchers and practitioners to form actionable insights with respect to how technology designs support or undermine basic psychological needs, thereby increasing motivation and engagement, and ultimately, improving user wellbeing. We propose that in order to address wellbeing, psychological needs must be considered within five different spheres of analysis including: at the point of technology adoption, during interaction with the interface, as a result of engagement with technology-specific tasks, as part of the technology-supported behavior, and as part of an individual’s life overall. These five spheres of experience sit within a sixth, society, which encompasses both direct and collateral effects of technology use as well as non-user experiences. We build this model based on existing evidence for basic psychological need satisfaction, including evidence within the context of the workplace, computer games, and health. We extend and hone these ideas to provide practical advice for designers along with real world examples of how to apply the model to design practice.},

Results: In India, \textasciitilde 33\% of the urban population lives in slums with suboptimal vaccination coverage ranging from 14\% to upto 90\%. Few of the important causes for low coverage included socioeconomic factors such as poor community participation, lack of awareness, frequent migration, and loss of daily income. Hence, mere presence of vaccines in the National Immunization Program doesn't do the job, there is a definite unmet need to emphasize upon the importance of immunization among slums dwellers and take necessary steps. For instance, delivering immunization services at the doorstep (e.g. pulse polio program), community-based education, text messaging as reminders and incentivized immunization services are some of the opportunities that can be explored and implemented to improve immunization status in the slums. Conclusion: Thus, in addition to inclusion of more and more vaccines in the National Immunization Program, there is a definite need to focus on people living in high risk areas in order to improve coverage and healthcare indicators.},

Gamification and game-based learning systems aim to bring these benefits into the learning and teaching process. This paper presents a systematic literature review of game-based learning systems, frameworks that integrate game design elements, and various implementations of gamification in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in education for this review. The objective is to identify how gamified learning systems can be used and categorize its usefulness in higher education. The findings of this literature review allow higher education universities to employ and explore efficient gamified learning and teaching systems to improve student engagement, motivation, and performance.},

  abstract = {Issue: Research in education, including health professions education, has long struggled with the competing concerns of academic and practice-based stakeholders. Inspired partially by the work of Stokes and other theorists in science and technology studies, we propose that discussions about compelling research in health professions education might be usefully advanced by considering what it would mean if the community framed itself as a knowledge-producing field instead of aligning itself with either disciplinary or practical interests. Evidence: Efforts to foreground disciplinary or practical interests in education research have been unproductive, leading to the privileging of one group’s expertise at the expense of the other. Currently proposed principles and practices for responding to the divergence between these interests, such as knowledge translation or practitioner inquiry, have yielded comparatively little in the way of mutual satisfaction. Implications: As a field, health professions education research would not privilege either disciplinary or practical interests, nor would it attempt any sort of definitive blueprint for resolution to the tension. Rather it would regard these interests as inherently interconnected and, therefore, always in tension to varying degrees. The challenge for a field is not to resolve that tension but to harness it in productive ways through collaboration, negotiation, and compromise, through ever-shifting engagements that will not necessarily be comfortable but will nonetheless foster knowledge that resonates with all parts of the community.},

For decades, educators and scientists have engaged in an ongoing debate about whether higher order learning can only be enhanced by building a base of factual knowledge (analogous to Bloom’s taxonomy) or whether higher order learning can be enhanced directly by engaging in complex questioning and materials. The relationship between fact learning and higher order learning is often speculated, but empirically unknown. In this study, middle school students and college students engaged in retrieval practice with fact questions, higher order questions, or a mix of question types to examine the optimal type of retrieval practice for enhancing higher order learning. In laboratory and K-12 settings, retrieval practice consistently increased delayed test performance, compared with rereading or no quizzes. Critically, higher order and mixed quizzes improved higher order test performance, but fact quizzes did not. Contrary to popular intuition about higher order learning and Bloom’s taxonomy, building a foundation of knowledge via fact-based retrieval practice may be less potent than engaging in higher order retrieval practice, a key finding for future research and classroom application.},

  abstract = {Background: The medical education system based on principles advocated by Flexner and Osler has produced generations of scientifically grounded and clinically skilled physicians whose collective experiences and contributions have served medicine and patients well. Yet sweeping changes launched around the turn of the millennium have constituted a revolution in medical education. In this article, a critique is presented of the new undergraduate medical education (UME) curricula in relationship to graduate medical education (GME) and clinical practice. Discussion: Medical education has changed and will continue to change in response to scientific advances and societal needs. However, enthusiasm for reform needs to be tempered by a more measured approach to avoid unintended consequences. Movement from novice to master in medicine cannot be rushed. An argument is made for a shoring up of biomedical science in revised curricula with the beneficiaries being nascent practitioners, developing physician-scientists - and the public. Conclusion: Unless there is further modification, the new integrated curricula are at risk of produce graduates deficient in the characteristics that have set physicians apart from other healthcare professionals, namely high-level clinical expertise based on a deep grounding in biomedical science and understanding of the pathologic basis of disease. The challenges for education of the best possible physicians are great but the benefits to medicine and society are enormous.},

  abstract = {Online curricula can make high-quality health professions education accessible in virtually any setting. They can enhance teaching and learning by both standardizing curricular resources and individualizing curricular experiences. Despite growing demand for and institutional interest in online curricula for medical education, many medical educators lack a framework for online curriculum development. Without rigorous and thoughtful development, online curricula can waste opportunity and resources by leading to education that is inferior to traditional methods. In this article, the authors describe a systematic approach to online curriculum development based on the Six-Step Approach for Curriculum Development for Medical Education, a widely used method that has led to successful implementation of a variety of traditional and online curricula. In each step, special considerations for curricula with larger and more diverse learner audiences—characteristic of many online curricula—are highlighted. Four common online curricular formats are also discussed: blended curricula, instructor-led fully online curricula, self-paced modules, and massive open online courses (MOOCs). The authors emphasize factors that differentiate one online format from another, including the budgetary, technical, and human resource requirements for each. The article concludes by urging medical educators to pursue opportunities to study and disseminate online curricular work.},

  abstract = {Open-ended questions, in which participants write or type their responses, are used in many areas of the behavioral sciences. Although effective in the lab, they are relatively untested in online experiments, and the quality of responses is largely unexplored. Closed-ended questions are easier to use online because they generally require only single key- or mouse-press responses and are less cognitively demanding, but they can bias the responses. We compared the data quality obtained using open and closed response formats using the continued-influence effect (CIE), in which participants read a series of statements about an unfolding event, one of which is unambiguously corrected later. Participants typically continue to refer to the corrected misinformation when making inferential statements about the event. We implemented this basic procedure online (Exp. 1A, n = 78), comparing standard open-ended responses to an alternative procedure using closed-ended responses (Exp. 1B, n = 75). Finally, we replicated these findings in a larger preregistered study (Exps. 2A and 2B, n = 323). We observed the CIE in all conditions: Participants continued to refer to the misinformation following a correction, and their references to the target misinformation were broadly similar in number across open- and closed-ended questions. We found that participants' open-ended responses were relatively detailed (including an average of 75 characters for inference questions), and almost all responses attempted to address the question. The responses were faster, however, for closed-ended questions. Overall, we suggest that with caution it may be possible to use either method for gathering CIE data.},

  abstract = {Significance             Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college STEM instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.           ,              We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

  abstract = {Over 25 years ago Ericsson et al. (1993) published the results of their search for the most effective forms of training in music, a domain where knowledge of effective training has been accumulated over centuries. At music academies master teachers provide students individualized instruction and help them identify goals and methods for their practice sessions between meetings – this form of solitary practice was named deliberate practice, and its accumulated duration during development was found to distinguish groups with differing levels of attained music performance. In an influential meta-analysis Macnamara et al. (2014) identified studies that had collected estimates of practice accumulated during development and attained performance and reported that individual differences in deliberate practice accounted for only 14\% of variance in performance. Their definition of “deliberate practice” differs significantly from the original definition of deliberate practice and will henceforth be referred to as structured practice. We explicate three criteria for reproducible performance and purposeful/deliberate practice and exclude all effect sizes considered by Macnamara et al. (2014) that were based on data not meeting these criteria. A reanalysis of the remaining effects estimated that accumulated duration of practice explained considerably more variance in performance (29 and 61\% after attenuation correction). We also address the argument that the limited amount of variance explained by the duration of practice necessarily implies an important role of genetic factors, and we report that genetic effects have so far accounted for remarkably small amounts of variance – with exception of genetic influences of height and body size. The paper concludes with recommendations for how future research on purposeful and deliberate practice can go beyond recording only the duration of practice to measuring the quality of practice involving concentration, analysis, and problem solving to identify conditions for the most effective forms of training.},

Initially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis to gain insight from data. Subsequently, two datasets were obtained. The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood’, ‘school’ and ‘age’ are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.},

Medical students with pre‐medical backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences may be more likely to acquire skills relevant to patient‐centred communication, either prior to or during medical school.                                         Objectives                                The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between pre‐medical backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences and outcomes in medical school, including in communication and interpersonal skills (                 CIS                 ), licensure examination results and postgraduate specialty choice (primary care versus non‐primary care specialties).                                                        Methods                                The American Medical College Application Service database was used to identify pre‐medical college majors, demographic characteristics, Medical College Admission Test scores and college grade point averages for medical students at a large, midwestern medical school. Data were obtained for 465 medical students across three cohorts (classes of 2014–2016). Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine relationships between pre‐medical background, performance on graduation competency examination standardised patient encounter                 CIS                 scores and on United States Medical Licensing Examination (                 USMLE                 ) Step~1 and Step~2 Clinical Knowledge scores, and postgraduate specialty choice.                                                        Results                                Graduating medical students with pre‐medical humanities or social sciences majors performed significantly better in terms of                 CIS                 than those with natural science majors (Cohen's                 d~                 =                 ~                 0.28, p                 ~                 =                 ~                 0.011). There were no significant associations between pre‐medical majors and                 USMLE                 Step~1 and Step~2 Clinical Knowledge scores or postgraduate specialty choice.                                                        Conclusions               These results suggest that considering humanistic factors as part of admissions criteria may promote the selection and training of physicians with good communication skills.                        ,              What value hath the humanities and social sciences? This study revealed that medical students with such backgrounds performed better on communication and interpersonal skills measures than peers with natural science backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Immunology is now a major component of studies in human biology, with many diseases having immune system involvement. Because so many areas of study include aspects of immunological knowledge, how to teach and incorporate immunology must be evaluated and assessed at all levels of education including K-12, undergraduate, graduate, medical, and professional programs. Traditional teaching methods such as lecture have significant shortcomings which make them less appealing to students today who are more digitally inclined and demand more active and engaging learning environments. Herein, we describe and propose the use of the active learning model of Team-Based Learning (TBL) to incorporate immunology into medical and professional programs. TBL is defined as an evidence based collaborative learning strategy taught in a three-step cycle: pre-class preparation, in-class readiness assurance testing (RAT), and application-focused exercises. In TBL, students are assigned to 6–7 member teams. Students complete the in-class RAT individually followed by taking the RAT as a team (T-RAT). Following the RAT and T-RAT, the instructor can then provide immediate feedback on concepts that proved especially difficult. The remainder of class time is then spent with teams working case studies and applications relative to the instructional topic or disease. Teams decide the best outcome or answer for a given application and report their answers simultaneously in class, followed by a discussion facilitated by the instructor. Research indicates that students involved in active learning classes, such as those using TBL have significantly increased levels of student engagement and high performance on examinations. This review will highlight how to implement TBL into a professional program (medical, dental, nursing, or pharmacy), how to assess student performance and provide real world examples of case studies and applications.},

  abstract = {Background: A curriculum is dynamic entity and hence, metaphorically, can be considered ‘alive’. Curricular diseases may impair its quality and hence its viability. The quality of a curriculum is typically assessed against certain quality standards only. This approach does not identify the inhibitors impeding the achievement of quality standards. The purpose of this study is to identify not only standards but also inhibitors of curriculum quality, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of what we coin ‘curriculum viability’. Methods: We performed a scoping review of ‘curriculum viability’, after which 13 articles were found eligible through a meticulous search and selection process. We first identified 1233 studies based on matching keywords, title and abstract; 36 of which met our inclusion criteria. After application of the Qualsyst criteria, two independent reviewers performed a thematic analysis of the 13 articles that remained. Results: While all studies reported on standards of quality, only two studies described both standards and inhibitors of quality. These standards and inhibitors were related to educational content and strategy, students, faculty, assessment, educational/work environment, communication, technology and leadership. Conclusions: The framework of curriculum viability thus developed will help identify inhibitors adversely affecting the curriculum viability and remaining hidden or un-noticed when curriculum evaluation is done.},

However, the extent to which the current evidence base supports this investment is currently unclear, and particularly so in relation to the effectiveness of interventions based on predictive models. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review and quality assessment of studies on the use of learning analytics in higher education, focusing specifically on intervention studies. Search terms identified 689 papers, but only 11 studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on learning analytics. These studies highlighted the potential of such interventions, but the general quality of the research was moderate, and left several important questions unanswered. The key recommendation based on this review is that more research into the implementation and evaluation of scientifically driven learning analytics is needed to build a solid evidence base for the feasibility, effectiveness and generalizability of such interventions. This is particularly relevant when considering the increasing tendency of educational institutions around the world to implement learning analytics interventions with only little evidence of their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: Struggling medical students is an under-researched in medical education. It is known, however, that early identification is important for effective remediation. The aim of the study was to determine the predictive effect of medical school admission tools regarding whether a student will struggle academically. Methods: Data comprise 700 students from the University of New South Wales undergraduate medical program. The main outcome of interest was whether these students struggled during this 6-year program; they were classified to be struggling they failed any end-of-phase examination but still graduated from the program. Discriminate Function Analysis (DFA) assessed whether their pre-admission academic achievement, Undergraduate Medicine Admission Test (UMAT) and interview scores had predictive effect regarding likelihood to struggle. Results: A lower pre-admission academic achievement in the form of Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) or Grade Point Average (GPA) were found to be the best positive predictors of whether a student was likely to struggle. Lower UMAT and poorer interview scores were found to have a comparatively much smaller predictive effect. Conclusion: Although medical admission tests are widely used, medical school rarely use these data for educational purposes. The results of this study suggest admission test data can predict who among the admitted students is likely to struggle in the program. Educationally, this information is invaluable. These results indicate that pre-admission academic achievement can be used to predict which students are likely to struggle in an Australian undergraduate medicine program. Further research into predicting other types of struggling students as well as remediation methods are necessary.},

A total of 1072 undergraduate students participated in this study (Mage = 22.7 years; 58.4\% female). To test for profile similarity, participants were divided into three age categories. Latent profile analyses revealed five distinct motivation profiles: Knowledge-Oriented, Controlled, Multifaceted, Unmotivated, and Hedonist profiles. These profiles, as well as their associations with the covariates, were similar across gender and age groups. Students’ level of vitality varied across profiles and was higher in the Hedonist and Knowledge-Oriented profiles, whereas both parents’ warmth predicted membership in profiles characterized by high levels of intrinsic motivation.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of the study was to describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a flipped classroom teaching approach in physiotherapy education. The flipped classroom is a blended learning approach in which students receive digital lectures as homework, while active learning activities are used in the classroom. Flipped classroom teaching enables a learning environment that aims to develop higher-order cognitive skills. Methods: The study design was a historically controlled, prospective, cohort study. An eight week theoretical course on musculoskeletal disorders was redesigned, moving from a conventional approach to a flipped classroom model. Pre-class learning material consisted of about 12 h of video lectures and other digital learning resources that were split up over the duration of the course. In-class activities consisted of seven full-day seminars where students worked in groups in order to solve problem-based assignments. The assignments were designed to reflect authentic clinical problems and required critical thinking and reasoning. Outcomes were measured with course-grades and compared with historical controls of conventional teaching, using descriptive statistics. Self-perceived learning outcomes and students' experiences were also collected in a survey. Results: Fifty-one students passed the course exam, two failed and one did not attend (n = 54). The share of students with Excellent, Very good and Good (ABC) performances increased by more than 10\% relative to any previous year. In addition, Satisfactory, Sufficient and Failed performances (DEF) decreased by more than 10\%. Almost two thirds of the students preferred the flipped classroom approach as compared with conventional teaching. Interaction with peers and educators, and flexibility, were the most positive factors that were reported by students. Long seminars, time-constraints and low motivation with respect to preparation and educators' roles were the most common complaints. Conclusions: A flipped classroom approach in physiotherapy education resulted in improved student performances in this professional programme, when compared with conventional teaching. Students responded positively to the collaborative learning environment, especially with respect to the associated autonomy and flexibility. There were indicators that all groups did not work optimally and that accountability to other group members did not always ensure pre-classroom preparations.},

  abstract = {Educational institutions are increasingly turning to learning analytics to identify and intervene with students at risk of underperformance or discontinuation. However, the extent to which the current evidence base supports this investment is currently unclear, and particularly so in relation to the effectiveness of interventions based on predictive models. The aim of the present paper was to conduct a systematic review and quality assessment of studies on the use of learning analytics in higher education, focusing specifically on intervention studies. Search terms identified 689 articles, but only 11 studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions based on learning analytics. These studies highlighted the potential of such interventions, but the general quality of the research was moderate, and left several important questions unanswered. The key recommendation based on this review is that more research into the implementation and evaluation of scientifically driven learning analytics is needed to build a solid evidence base for the feasibility, effectiveness, and generalizability of such interventions. This is particularly relevant when considering the increasing tendency of educational institutions around the world to implement learning analytics interventions with only little evidence of their effectiveness.},

Diane Tavenner founded the first Summit charter school in 2003, developing and perfecting a personalized, project-based curriculum that puts students in charge of their own learning. The school developed a learning plan for every student. They engaged the students by appealing to them with interdisciplinary, real-world projects, rather than passively learning and memorizing in a classroom environment. They created mentorship groups, where students would talk through their goals and help each other solve problems, as well as meet one-on-one with their mentor, weekly. By internalizing a sense of purpose, self-direction, self-sufficiency, and collaboration, students learn the cognitive and life skills needed to navigate the next phases of their lives. Virtually 100\% of Summit's original 400 students went on to attend four year colleges"--},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives:\enspace{} Europe has experienced a major resurgence of measles in recent years, despite the availability and free access to a safe, effective, and affordable vaccination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR). The main driver for this is suboptimal vaccine coverage. Parental attitudes and beliefs toward measles vaccination are of paramount importance in influencing vaccine coverage. The three objectives of this study are to synthesize and critically assess parental attitudes and beliefs toward MMR uptake, to develop strategies and policy recommendations to effectively improve MMR vaccine uptake accordingly, and ultimately to identify areas for further research. Methods:\enspace{} A systematic review was conducted using primary studies from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus published between 2011 and April 2019. Inclusion criteria comprised primary studies in English conducted in Europe and studying parental attitudes and behavior regarding MMR uptake. Data were extracted using an inductive grounded theory approach. Results:\enspace{} In all, 20 high-quality studies were identified. Vaccine hesitancy or refusal were mainly due to concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness, perception of measles risk and burden, mistrust in experts, and accessibility. Factors for MMR uptake included a sense of responsibility toward child and community health, peer judgement, trust in experts and vaccine, and measles severity. Anthroposophical and Gypsy, Roma, and Traveler populations presented unique barriers such as accessibility. Conclusion:\enspace{} A multi-interventional, evidence-based approach is vital to improve confidence, competence, and convenience of measles vaccination uptake. Healthcare professionals need an understanding of individual contextual attitudes and barriers to MMR uptake to tailor effective communication. Effective surveillance is needed to identify under-vaccinated populations for vaccination outreach programs to improve accessibility and uptake.},

What if you could harness the extraordinary power of your unconscious mind, which already determines so much of what you do, to achieve your goals? Shockingly, we spend nearly half our day repeating things we've done in the past without thinking about them. How we respond to the people around us; the way we conduct ourselves in meetings; what we buy; when and how we exercise, eat and drink - a truly remarkable number of things we do every day, we do by habit. And yet, whenever we want to change something about ourselves, we rely on willpower alone. We hope that our determination and intention will be enough to effect positive change. And that is why almost all of us fail. Professor Wendy Wood is the world's foremost expert on habits. By drawing on three decades of original research, she explains the fascinating science of how we form habits and provides the key to unlocking our habitual mind in order to make the changes we seek. Combining a potent mix of neuroscience, case studies and experiments conducted in her lab, Good Habits, Bad Habits is a comprehensive, accessible and highly practical book that will change the way you think about almost every aspect of your life},

A core assumption is that gamification should be able to increase the ability of a system or a service to satisfy intrinsic needs, and thereby the autotelicy of use as well as consequent change in beneficial behaviors. However, beyond these optimistic expectations, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on how different gamification features satisfy different dimensions intrinsic needs. Therefore, in this study we investigate the relationships between the user (N = 824) interactions with gamification features (immersion, achievement and social -related features) and intrinsic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness needs) in Xiaomi and Huawei online gamified communities that represent two large technology product-related online brand communities in China through a survey-based study. The results indicate that immersion-related gamification features were only positively associated with autonomy need satisfaction. Achievement-related features were not only positively associated with all kinds of need satisfaction, but also the strongest predictor of both autonomy and competence need satisfaction. Social-related gamification features, were positively associated with autonomy, competence and relatedness need satisfaction. The results imply that gamification can have a substantially positive effect on intrinsic need satisfaction for services users.},

  abstract = {Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education--a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself--among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgar, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship--without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success},

  abstract = {Work-integrated learning (WIL) is a feature of university courses, both in professional areas, where it is commonplace, but also across many different disciplines. Assessment of WIL can be complex as it involves parties and settings external to the university, and it can be problematic because of difficulties in aligning learning activities during placements with what is or can be assessed by the university. This paper explores the relationship between students’ placement experiences and accompanying assessments in contexts where activities are tightly coupled with the curriculum, and in those where it is not. It draws on a qualitative analysis of student interviews and drawings by the interviewees of their WIL experiences, supplemented with analysis of unit guides. Our findings highlight that students’ perceptions of authenticity of assessment were undermined by misalignments between the student, university and industry. Assessment authenticity was perceived by students as based on alignment between their current and future selves in the assessment process, involvement of industry supervisors and relevance of placement activities to assessment activities. The paper discusses the complexity of coordination of educational activities with external partners, especially when one party drives assessment.

  abstract = {E-learning, as a direct result of the integration of technology and education, has emerged as a powerful medium of learning particularly using Internet technologies. The undeniable significance of e-learning in education has led to a massive growth in the number of e-learning courses and systems offering different types of services. Thus, evaluation of e-learning -systems is vital to ensure successful delivery, effective use, and positive impacts on learners. Based on an intensive review of the literature, a comprehensive model has been developed which provides a holistic picture and identifies different levels of success related to a broad range of success determinants. The model has been empirically validated by fitting the model to data collected from 563 students engaged with an e-learning system in one of the UK universities through a quantitative method of Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The determinants of e-learning perceived satisfaction are technical system quality, information quality, service quality, support system quality, learner quality, instructor quality, and perceived usefulness, which together explain 71.4\% of the variance of perceived satisfaction. The drivers of perceived usefulness are technical system quality, information quality, support system quality, learner quality, and instructor quality, and these explain 54.2\% of the variance of perceived usefulness. Four constructs were found to be the determinants of e-learning use, namely educational system quality, support system quality, learner quality, and perceived usefulness, and together they account for 34.1\%. Finally, 64.7\% of the variance of e-learning benefits was explained by perceived usefulness, perceived satisfaction, and use.},

This paper reports the psychometric properties of the University Student Engagement Inventory (USEI) with a sample of 3992 university students from nine different countries and regions from Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia. The USEI operationalizes a trifactorial conceptualization of academic engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive). Construct validity was assessed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega coefficients. Weak measurement invariance was observed for country/region, while strong measurement invariance was observed for gender and area of graduation. The USEI scores showed predictive validity for dropout intention, self-rated academic performance, and course approval rate while divergent validity with student burnout scores was also evident. Overall, the results indicate that the USEI can produce reliable and valid data on academic engagement of university students across the world.},

To examine this question, we conducted a long-term follow-up of a randomized social-belonging intervention delivered in the first year of college. This 1-hour exercise represented social and academic adversity early in college as common and temporary. As previously reported in               Science               , the exercise improved black students’ grades and well-being in college. The present study assessed the adult outcomes of these same participants. Examining adult life at an average age of 27, black adults who had received the treatment (versus control) exercise 7 to 11 years earlier reported significantly greater career satisfaction and success, psychological well-being, and community involvement and leadership. Gains were statistically mediated by greater college mentorship. The results suggest that addressing persistent social-psychological concerns via psychological intervention can shape the life course, partly by changing people’s social realities.},

By focusing on how trainees fine-tune their strategic learning, theories of self-regulated learning (SRL) offer a unique lens to study workplace learning. To date, studies of SRL in the workplace tend to focus on listing the factors affecting learning, rather than on the specific mechanisms trainees use to regulate their goal-directed activities. To inform the design of workplace learning interventions that better support SRL, we asked: How do residents navigate their exposure to and experience performing invasive procedures in intensive care units? Methods: In two academic hospitals, we conducted post-call debriefs with residents coming off shift and later sought their elaborated perspectives via semi-structured interviews. We used a constant comparative methodology to analyse the data, to iteratively refine data collection, and to inform abductive coding of the data, using SRL principles as sensitising concepts.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The role of medical students in catalyzing and leading curricular change in US medical schools is not well described. Here, American Medical Association student and physician leaders in the Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative use qualitative methods to better define student leadership in curricular change. Methods: The authors developed case studies describing student leadership in curricular change efforts. Case studies were presented at a national medical education workshop; participants provided worksheet reflections and were surveyed, and responses were transcribed. Kotter’s change management framework was used to categorize reported student roles in curricular change. Thematic analysis was used to identify barriers to student engagement and activators to overcome these barriers. Results: Student roles spanned all eight steps of Kotter’s change management framework. Barriers to student engagement were related to faculty (e.g. view student roles narrowly), students (e.g. fear change or expect faculty-led curricula), or both (e.g. lack leadership training). Activators were: (1) recruiting collaborative faculty, staff, and students; (2) broadening student leadership roles; (3) empowering student leaders; and (4) recognizing student successes. Conclusions: By applying these activators, medical schools can build robust student–faculty partnerships that maximize collaboration, moving students beyond passive educational consumption to change agency and curricular co-creation.},

Intentional design of the data collection can enable iterative testing of an instructional design. In this study, we propose that across a population of learners the information from multiple choice question responses can help to identify which design features are associated with positive learner engagement. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that, within an online module that presents serial knowledge content, measures of click-level behavior will show sufficient, but variable, association with a test-measure so as to potentially guide instructional design. Method: The Aquifer online learning platform employs interactive approaches to enable effective learning of health professions content. A multidisciplinary focus group of experts identified potential learning analytic measures within an Aquifer learning module, including: hyperlinks clicked (yes/no), magnify buttons clicked (yes/no), expert advice links clicked (yes/no), and time spent on each page (seconds). Learning analytics approaches revealed which click-level data was correlated with the subsequent relevant Case MCQ. We report regression coefficients where the dependent variable is student accuracy on the Case MCQ as a general indicator of successful engagement. Results: Clicking hyperlinks, magnifying images, clicking “expert” links, and spending {$>$}100 seconds on each page were learning analytic measures and were positively correlated with Case MCQ success; rushing through pages ({$<$}20 seconds) was inversely correlated with success. Conversely, for some measures, we failed to find expected associations. Conclusions: In online learning environments, the wealth of process data available offers insights for instructional designers to iteratively hone the effectiveness of learning. Learning analytic measures of engagement can provide feedback as to which interaction elements are effective.},

  abstract = {The flipped classroom has been increasingly employed as a pedagogical strategy in the higher education classroom. This approach commonly involves pre-class learning activities that are delivered online through learning management systems that collect learning analytics data on student access patterns. This study sought to utilize learning analytics data to understand student learning behavior in a flipped classroom. The data analyzed three key parameters; the number of online study sessions for each individual student, the size of the sessions (number of topics covered), and the first time they accessed their materials relative to the relevant class date. The relationship between these parameters and academic performance was also explored. The study revealed patterns of student access changed throughout the course period, and most students did access their study materials before the relevant classroom session. Using k-means clustering as the algorithm, consistent early access to learning materials was associated with improved academic performance in this context. Insights derived from this study informed iterative improvements to the learning design of the course. Similar analyses could be applied to other higher education learning contexts as a feedback tool for educators seeking to improve the online learning experience of their students.},

Amongst other things, the platform generates ‘no-engagement’ alerts if students have not engaged with any of the data sources measured for 14 consecutive days. We tested the relationship between these alerts and student outcomes for two cohorts of first-year undergraduate students. We also compared the efficiency of using these alerts to identify students at risk of poorer outcomes with the efficiency of using demographic data, using widening participation status as a case study example. The noengagement alerts were found to be more efficient at spotting students not progressing and not attaining than demographic data. In order to investigate the efficacy of learning analytics for addressing differential student outcomes for disadvantaged groups, the team also analysed the likelihood of students with widening participation status generating alerts compared with their non-widening participation counterparts. The odds of students with widening participation status generating an alert were on average 43\% higher, demonstrating the potential of such a system to preferentially target support at disadvantaged groups without needing to target directly based on immutable factors such as their socio-economic background.},

  abstract = {Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020. This rapid systematic review synthesised published reports of medical educational developments in response to the pandemic, considering descriptions of interventions, evaluation data and lessons learned. Methods: The authors systematically searched four online databases and hand searched MedEdPublish up to 24 May 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias for included articles. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. A descriptive synthesis and outcomes were reported. Results: Forty-nine articles were included. The majority were from North America, Asia and Europe. Sixteen studies described Kirkpatrick’s outcomes, with one study describing levels 1–3. A few papers were of exceptional quality, though the risk of bias framework generally revealed capricious reporting of underpinning theory, resources, setting, educational methods, and content. Key developments were pivoting educational delivery from classroom-based learning to virtual spaces, replacing clinical placement based learning with alternate approaches, and supporting direct patient contact with mitigated risk. Training for treating patients with COVID-19, service reconfiguration, assessment, well-being, faculty development, and admissions were all addressed, with the latter categories receiving the least attention. Conclusions: This review highlights several areas of educational response in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies a few articles of exceptional quality that can serve as models for future developments and educational reporting. There was often a lack of practical detail to support the educational community in enactment of novel interventions, as well as limited evaluation data. However, the range of options deployed offers much guidance for the medical education community moving forward and there was an indication that outcome data and greater detail will be reported in the future.},

Analyzing the footprints left behind from these online interactions is useful for understanding the effectiveness of this kind of learning. Video-based learning with flipped teaching can help improve student’s academic performance. This study was carried out with 772 examples of students registered in e-commerce and e-commerce technologies modules at an HEI. The study aimed to predict student’s overall performance at the end of the semester using video learning analytics and data mining techniques. Data from the student information system, learning management system and mobile applications were analyzed using eight different classification algorithms. Furthermore, data transformation and preprocessing techniques were carried out to reduce the features. Moreover, genetic search and principle component analysis were carried out to further reduce the features. Additionally, the CN2 Rule Inducer and multivariate projection can be used to assist faculty in interpreting the rules to gain insights into student interactions. The results showed that Random Forest accurately predicted successful students at the end of the class with an accuracy of 88.3\% with an equal width and information gain ratio.},

  abstract = {Objective: The authors reviewed educational interventions for improving literature searching skills in the health sciences. Methods: We performed a scoping review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies published in English and German, irrespective of publication year. Targeted outcomes were objectively measurable literature searching skills (e.g., quality of search strategy, study retrieval, precision). The search methods consisted of searching databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science), tracking citations, free web searching, and contacting experts. Two reviewers performed screening and data extraction. To evaluate the completeness of reporting, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) was applied. Results: We included 6 controlled trials and 8 pre-post trials from the 8,484 references that we screened. Study participants were students in various health professions and physicians. The educational formats of the interventions varied. Outcomes clustered into 2 categories: (1) developing search strategies (e.g., identifying search concepts, selecting databases, applying Boolean operators) and (2) database searching skills (e.g., searching PubMed, MEDLINE, or CINAHL). In addition to baseline and post-intervention measurement, 5 studies reported follow-up. Almost all studies adequately described their intervention procedures and delivery but did not provide access to the educational material. The expertise of the intervention facilitators was described in only 3 studies. Conclusions: The results showed a wide range of study populations, interventions, and outcomes. Studies often lacked information about educational material and facilitators’ expertise. Further research should focus on intervention effectiveness using controlled study designs and long-term follow-up. To ensure transparency, replication, and comparability, studies should rigorously describe their intervention.},

Medical education researchers face an overwhelming taxonomy of study design options; given the breadth of information on experimental design, the purpose of this Guide is to offer a resource for medical education researchers wishing to equip themselves with helpful information for when to match a study’s objective and the use of randomised designs. Once a research question has been formulated study design is the cornerstone of the intricate, nested activities of any research project. Researchers negotiate many decisions in the pursuit of choosing an appropriate design approach; failure to do so can undermine a project’s capacity to, for example, sufficiently test a hypothesis or theory. Written as an introduction, this Guide is intended for medical education researchers seeking to build on and synthesise the existing corpus of literature on experimental and quasi-experimental design approaches. While not comprehensive, presented are key concepts alongside relevant examples from the field of health professions education.},

In this Guide, we outline what thematic analysis is, positioning it in relation to other methods of qualitative analysis, and describe when it is appropriate to use the method under a variety of epistemological frameworks. We also provide a detailed definition of a theme, as this term is often misapplied. Next, we describe the most commonly used six-step framework for conducting thematic analysis, illustrating each step using examples from our own research. Finally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of this method and alert researchers to pitfalls to avoid when using thematic analysis. We aim to highlight thematic analysis as a powerful and flexible method of qualitative analysis and to empower researchers at all levels of experience to conduct thematic analysis in rigorous and thoughtful way.},

Recent efforts have used clickstream data to create timely, fine-grained, and comprehensive measures of self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses in an attempt to shed light on the process of SRL and to improve the identification of students who lack SRL skills and are at risk of low achievement. However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.},

  abstract = {The prediction of student academic performance has drawn considerable attention in education. However, although the learning outcomes are believed to improve learning and teaching, prognosticating the attainment of student outcomes remains underexplored. A decade of research work conducted between 2010 and November 2020 was surveyed to present a fundamental understanding of the intelligent techniques used for the prediction of student performance, where academic success is strictly measured using student learning outcomes. The electronic bibliographic databases searched include ACM, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science. Eventually, we synthesized and analyzed a total of 62 relevant papers with a focus on three perspectives, (1) the forms in which the learning outcomes are predicted, (2) the predictive analytics models developed to forecast student learning, and (3) the dominant factors impacting student outcomes. The best practices for conducting systematic literature reviews, e.g., PICO and PRISMA, were applied to synthesize and report the main results. The attainment of learning outcomes was measured mainly as performance class standings (i.e., ranks) and achievement scores (i.e., grades). Regression and supervised machine learning models were frequently employed to classify student performance. Finally, student online learning activities, term assessment grades, and student academic emotions were the most evident predictors of learning outcomes. We conclude the survey by highlighting some major research challenges and suggesting a summary of significant recommendations to motivate future works in this field.},

  abstract = {Research paradigms guide scientific discoveries through their assumptions and principles. Understanding paradigm-specific assumptions helps illuminate the quality of findings that support scientific studies and identify gaps in generating sound evidence. This article focuses on the research paradigm of               positivism               , examining its definition, history, and assumptions (ontology, epistemology, axiology, methodology, and rigor). Positivism is aligned with the hypothetico-deductive model of science that builds on verifying a priori hypotheses and experimentation by operationalizing variables and measures; results from hypothesis testing are used to inform and advance science. Studies aligned with positivism generally focus on identifying explanatory associations or causal relationships through quantitative approaches, where empirically based findings from large sample sizes are favored—in this regard, generalizable inferences, replication of findings, and controlled experimentation have been principles guiding positivist science. Criteria for evaluating the quality of positivist research are discussed. An example from health professions education is provided to guide positivist thinking in study design and implementation.},

In this paper, we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach. We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years. Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter. The steady increase in students’ learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities.},

The authors use the analogy of a hiker to illustrate how different researchers studying a similar phenomenon can choose among different research directions, which lead down different paths and offer different perspectives on a problem. Following the hiker analogy, the authors use the “Research Compass” to categorize the 15 research papers included in the 2020 Research in Medical Education supplement according to their research aim and corresponding methodological approach. The authors then discuss implications of the relative balance of these study types within this supplement and within health professions education research at large, emphasizing the critical importance of studying a topic from multiple vantage points to construct a richer and more nuanced understanding of health professions education challenges. The authors conclude by recognizing the challenges we face in the current era of COVID-19 and by calling health professions education researchers and practitioners to continue our collective efforts to improve learner education and patient care, as we together navigate the unfamiliar terrain of the present day.},

Why do you need an eLearning storyboard, and how do you write one? How do you develop a prototype of your eLearning course? And, what the heck is a prototype anyway? When and where should you include interactivity? When should you let your SMEs review your course? And what's a "SME" again? And what do you do when they don't give you feedback? Trying to get answers to all of these questions can quickly leave you saying to yourself, "I don't think I'm cut out for this eLearning thing!" But, here's some good news: you're not alone! The truth is, most eLearning designers entered fell, stumbled, and dropped into the world of eLearning entirely by accident.

To meet the needs of healthcare in the twenty-first century, competent leaders will be increasingly important across all health professions, including allied health, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and medicine. Consequently, incorporation of leadership training and development should be part of all health professional curricula. A new type of leader is emerging: one who role models the balance between autonomy and accountability, emphasises teamwork, and focuses on improving patient outcomes. Healthcare education leaders are required to work effectively and collaboratively across discipline and organisational boundaries, where titles are not always linked to leadership roles.

In this article, the authors set out to clarify the meaning of these terms and to describe how they are used in 2 approaches to research commonly used in HPE: the objectivist deductive approach (from theory to data) and the subjectivist inductive approach (from data to theory). In addition to this, given that within subjectivist inductive research theory, theoretical framework, and conceptual framework can be used in different ways, they describe 3 uses that HPE researchers frequently rely on: fully inductive theory development, fully theory-informed inductive, and theory-informing inductive data analysis.},

Collaborating across these traditions is particularly generative, a phenomenon the authors call               the multidisciplinary edge effect               . However, to harness this productivity, scholars need to understand their own paradigms and those of others so that collaboration can flourish. This Invited Commentary introduces the Philosophy of Science series—a collection of articles that introduce readers to 7 different paradigms that are frequently used in HPE research or that the authors suggest will be increasingly common in future studies. Each article in the collection presents a concise and accessible description of the main principles of a paradigm so that researchers can quickly grasp how these traditions differ from each other. In this introductory article, the authors define and illustrate key terms that are essential to understanding these traditions (i.e., paradigm, ontology, epistemology, methodology, and axiology) and explain the structure that each article in this series follows.},

  abstract = {A number of factors can affect the quality of user experience within a service, for example, the public who accesses the service, the environment, the laws governing the provision of this service and where, etc. The combination of these possible uses characterizes the configuration of a service. This paper presents a strategy for decision making based on multidisciplinary criteria, entitled MPS-USE, that was developed to assist providers to configure services that offer quality in user experience. MPS-USE is based on 5 pillars: elements of user experience, human values; multicriteria approach; participative project; and quality model. The purpose of this article is to describe how the MPS-USE strategy was applied in a University setting to evaluate the configuration of an online course. The configuration considered the pedagogical practices and user experiences of this University to access the course. Results showed that the service configuration composed of multicriteria aligned with the interests of decision makers. In addition, students’ comments suggest that practices to implement configurations can be more appropriate to their needs. Finally, it was possible to verify if the configuration analyzed was in agreement with the interests of the decision makers.},

But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.

With the development of learning analytics, the delivery of intervention has been informed by data-driven approaches to identify learners’ problems and provide them with just-in-time and personalised support. However, intervention has been claimed to be the greatest challenge in learning analytics and has yet to be widely implemented. This paper reviews 24 case studies of learning analytics intervention in higher education. The cases were categorised and summarised according to their objectives, the data used, the intervention methods, the outcomes obtained and the challenges encountered. The results show that intervention practices have focused most frequently on increasing students’ study performance, offering personalised feedback and improving student retention. The frequent types of data involved students’ online learning behaviours, study performance, demographics and course selection information. The most commonly used intervention methods involved offering personalised recommendations and visualising learning data. The interventions have led to outcomes such as enhancing study performance, retention and course registration, as well as productivity and effectiveness in learning and teaching. The challenges covered a wide range of aspects, including the scalability of intervention, conditions for implementing intervention, limitations of the channels for delivering intervention and the evaluation of intervention effectiveness. The results suggest that learning analytics intervention has the potential to further extend its scope of practices to serve a wider range of purposes, but more studies on the empirical evidence, even with null or negative results, are needed to support its long-term effectiveness and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Background: Postresuscitation debriefing (PRD) is recommended by the American Heart Association guidelines but is infrequently performed. Prior studies have identified barriers for pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows including lack of a standardized curriculum. Objective: Our objective was to create and assess the feasibility of a timelimited, structured PRD framework entitled REFLECT: Review the event, Encourage team participation, Focused feedback, Listen to each other, Emphasize key points, Communicate clearly, and Transform the future. Methods: Each PEM fellow (n = 9) at a single center was a team leader of a pre-intervention and post-intervention videotaped, simulated resuscitation followed by a facilitated team PRD. Our intervention was a 2-hour interactive, educational workshop on debriefing and the use of the REFLECT debriefing aid. Videos of the pre-intervention and post-intervention debriefings were blindly analyzed by video reviewers to assess for the presence of debriefing characteristics contained in the REFLECT debriefing aid. PEM fellow and team member assessments of the debriefings were completed after each pre-intervention and post-intervention simulation, and written evaluations by PEM fellows and team members were analyzed. Results: All 9 PEM fellows completed the study. There was an improvement in the pre-intervention and post-intervention assessment of the REFLECT debriefing characteristics as determined by fellow perception (63\% to 83\%, P {$<$} 0.01) and team member perception (63\% to 82\%, P {$<$} 0.001). All debriefings lasted less than 5 minutes. There was no statistical difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention debriefing time (P = 1.00). Conclusions: REFLECT is a feasible debriefing aid designed to incorporate evidence-based characteristics into a PRD.},

  abstract = {Purpose               With the growing importance of professionalism in medical education, it is imperative to develop professionalism assessments that demonstrate robust validity evidence. The Professionalism Mini-Evaluation Exercise (P-MEX) is an assessment that has demonstrated validity evidence in the authentic clinical setting. Identifying the factorial structure of professionalism assessments determines professionalism constructs that can be used to provide diagnostic and actionable feedback. This study examines validity evidence for the P-MEX, a focused and standardized assessment of professionalism, in a simulated patient setting.                                         Method               The P-MEX was administered to 275 pediatric residency applicants as part of a 3-station standardized patient encounter, pooling data over an 8-year period (2012 to 2019 residency admission years). Reliability and construct validity for the P-MEX were evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).                                         Results               Cronbach’s alpha for the P-MEX was 0.91. The EFA yielded 4 factors: doctor–patient relationship skills, interprofessional skills, professional demeanor, and reflective skills. The CFA demonstrated good model fit with a root-mean-square error of approximation of .058 and a comparative fit index of .92, confirming the reproducibility of the 4-factor structure of professionalism.                                         Conclusions               The P-MEX demonstrates construct validity as an assessment of professionalism, with 4 underlying subdomains in doctor–patient relationship skills, interprofessional skills, professional demeanor, and reflective skills. These results yield new confidence in providing diagnostic and actionable subscores within the P-MEX assessment. Educators may wish to integrate the P-MEX assessment into their professionalism curricula.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Shame occurs when an individual blames a globally flawed self for a negative outcome. Much of the focus on shame in medical education has been directed toward graduate medical education with less recognition paid to shame occurring in medical school. In particular, while research has explored the triggers of medical students’ shame, little is known about what shame feels like, what it makes an individual want to do, and what perceived effects it causes. Thus, this study asks: After shame has been triggered in medical students, how is it experienced?                                         Method               The authors selected hermeneutic phenomenology to provide a rich description of the structures and meaning of medical students’ lived experiences of shame. Sixteen medical students from a private medical school in the United States were recruited for the study. Data were collected using one-on-one semistructured interviews and analyzed in accordance with Ajjawi and Higgs’ 6 steps of hermeneutic analysis.                                         Results               Data analysis yielded component parts of participants’ shame experiences, including affective feelings, physical manifestations, cognitive processes, action tendencies, and effects. Analysis of the relationships among these component parts yielded specific phenomenological structures, including patterns of shame (e.g., chronic shame, flashbacks), self-evaluative processes (e.g., battling voices, skewed frames of reference), and perceived effects of shame (e.g., isolation, psychological distress). An overarching theme of shame as a destabilizing emotion emerged across the dataset.                                         Conclusions               Shame is a complex emotion in medical students that, through its destabilizing effects, can lead to withdrawal, isolation, psychological distress, altered professional identity formation, and identity dissonance. The authors highlight the possibility that shame may be occurring as a response to educational trauma, present a metaphor of dominoes to conceptualize the destabilizing nature of shame, and outline the implications for individuals and institutions in medical education.},

With a nationwide secondary school online class dataset with 26,345 students, this study attempts to identify factors of student success and first constructs a statistical model predicting the pass probability of online classes. The following student background variables are associated with a high pass rate: transfer students, graduation-year students, pass-experienced students, and students not re-registering for the course. With respect to learning activities, students who actively communicate with teachers/ coordinators via messenger services or questions and answer sessions, or students who log in to the online class at the early stage of the semester are more likely to pass a course. Individual course characteristics are also found to be important for pass in courses requiring a summative exam, while courses for either subjects that have a good track record of students passing or courses for subjects that are taught by teachers with a good track record of students passing are correlated with a high pass rate. Logistic regression results suggest that the pass probability (odds ratio) is greatly increased when students have passing experience, actively interact with teachers/ coordinators, or when the subject has a good student passing record.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Quality of research is determined by many factors and one such climacteric factor is sample size. Inability to use correct sample size in study might lead to fallacious results in the form of rejection of true findings or approval of false results. Too large sample size is wastage of resources and use of too small sample size might fail to answer the research question or provide imprecise results and may question the validity of study. Despite being such a paramount aspect of research, the knowledge about sample size calculation is sparse among researchers. Why is it important to calculate sample size; when to calculate it; how to calculate it and what details about sample size calculation should be reported in research protocols or articles; are the lesser known basics to majority of researchers. The present review is directed to address these aforementioned fundamentals about sample size. Sample size should be calculated during the initial phase of planning of study. Several components are required for sample size calculation such as effect size, type-1 error, type-2 error, and variance. Researchers must be aware that there are different formulas for calculating sample size for different types of study designs. The researcher must include details about sample size calculation in the methodology section, so that it can be justified and it also adds to the transparency of the study. The literature about calculation of sample size for different study designs is scattered over many textbooks and journals. Scrupulous literature search was conducted to find the passable information for this review. This paper presents the sample size calculation formulas in a single review in a simplified manner with relevant examples, so that researchers may adequately use them in their research.},

This study examined the association between preadmission mental health evaluation and mental health service utilization among Thai medical students. Methods: The authors collected data from all first- to sixth-year students at one university hospital and three affiliated hospitals during the 2014 to 2019 academic year (n = 1642). Preadmission mental health was evaluated using the Thai Mental Health Indicators 66 (TMHI-66) questionnaire. Data from mental health service utilization included the dates of service and the clinical diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Cox regression, adjusted for sex, hometown, and affiliated hospital. Results: The prevalence of poor mental health was found to be 3.7\% based on TMHI-66 results. The proportion of all students who sought mental health services was 8.3\%, and they were mostly diagnosed with depressive disorder (3\%), adjustment disorder (1.9\%), and anxiety disorder (1.9\%). Students with positive TMHI-66 results were more likely to seek out services at the faculty counseling center for one or more mental health problems (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.11, 95\% CI 1.11-4.04, P = .024). Conclusion: Preadmission mental health was found to be associated with mental health service utilization. Depressive disorder was the most frequent mental illness among Thai medical students utilizing the faculty counseling services. Still, the number was far lower than the reported prevalence of mental disorders due to various reasons. Further studies are needed to investigate risk and protective factors for mental disorders to better promote mental health and encourage mental health service utilization in targeted students throughout medical education.},

Technology can be employed to ease the burden of the work; however, the researcher may not fully appreciate how and when computer software can assist in conducting qualitative analysis. In this, the third installment of our “how-­to” series on qualitative research methods, we describe basic concepts and approaches to using both simple word processing programs and specific qualitative research software programs to assist in coding and analysis. We hope that the concepts put forth in this paper will help qualitative researchers become more familiar with available technological approaches and that they will, in turn, enhance the efficiency of the research process as well as the depth, clarity and richness of research findings.},

The traditional classroom mode of teaching cannot meet the needs of modern medical education. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom (FC) combined with case- and team-based learning (FC-CTBL) for residency training. In this study, 60 junior surgical residents of Xiangya Medical College were enrolled. “Diabetic foot” was selected as the content of this study. Residents were divided into an FC-CTBL group and an FC group. FC-CTBL and FC were compared on the basis of residents’ feedback questionnaires, residents’ learning burden, test scores from a pre-quiz, and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE). Residents were more satisfied with the FC-CTBL model compared with FC. In the FC-CTBL group, more participants said that the course improved their teamwork skills, analytical skills and their confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems. Residents in the FCCTBL group also spent significantly less time preparing for class and performed better in the OSCE than those in the FC group. FCCTBL stimulates residents’ learning motivation, decreases their workload, improves their performance in the OSCE and may help to enhance clinical thinking and teamwork skills. The FC-CTBL approach is a good option for residency training.},

Accordingly, interventions to assist beginning college students in gateway courses have gained increased attention in higher education. This study tested such an intervention using learning analytics and early performance feedback in large introductory courses, with comparison between course sections not exposed to the intervention. Distinct from other research, the present study replicated the efficacy of the intervention across 2 years, in multiple course subjects, and with different instructors at a 4-year Hispanic-serving institution. Importantly, findings also showed that high-risk college students especially benefitted from the intervention in terms of both achievement and persistence. Based on these findings, recommendations are made to higher education administrators about the potential gains to students when they are provided with early, consistent, and individualized feedback in all courses, made feasible by current technology.},

A cross-sectional and ex post facto study was conducted with a sample of 1,159 students from the autonomous community of Andalusia (Spain). IBM SPSS R and IBM AMOS R software programs were used for data analysis. With regard to the main outcomes, the scale reflected good fit indices in its short form, presenting a more parsimonious and easily understood questionnaire. The questionnaire was reduced from a total of 28–19 items. In the same way, the number of dimensions was reduced from seven to four, facilitating scale understanding and interpretation according to selfdetermination theory. As a main finding, it was observed that the most relevant items for baccalaureate students pertained to the pleasure derived from discovering things and to overcoming challenges, whereas in VT students, items pertaining to the satisfaction generated from exerting effort, achieving one’s best and being well paid were more relevant. In conclusion, findings urge the need to strengthen intrinsic motivation in VT students with the aim of avoiding demotivation and poor academic performance.},

Literature suggests that the understanding of SRL among medical students is obscure as there is still some uncertainty about whether high performing medical students use SRL. This study explored the characteristics of high performing medical students from the SRL perspective to gain a better understanding of the application of SRL for effective learning. Methods: Twenty-one students who scored at the 90th percentile in written knowledge-based assessment consented to participate in this study. Each student wrote a guided reflective journal and subsequently attended a semi-structured interview. Students were prompted to explain the rationales for their answers. The data were then analysed using thematic analysis to identify patterns among these students from the SRL perspective. Two coders analysed the data independently and discussed the codes to reach a consensus. Results: High performing students set goals, made plans, and motivated themselves to achieve the goals. They put consistent efforts into their studies and applied effective learning strategies. They also employed coping mechanisms to deal with challenges. High performing students regularly evaluated their performance and adopted new strategies. Conclusions: This study reported that high performing students applied SRL and described the rationales of practice. Medical schools could design SRL-driven interventions to enhance the learning experiences of medical students. Recommendations are made for students on how to apply SRL.},

  abstract = {A fascinating exploration of the intricacies of how we remember, why we forget, and what we can do to protect our memories, from the Harvard-trained neuroscientist and bestselling author of Still Alice. Have you ever felt a crushing wave of panic when you can't for the life of you remember the name of that actor in the movie you saw last week, or you walk into a room only to forget why you went there in the first place? If you're over forty, you're probably not laughing. You might even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of Alzheimer's or dementia. In reality, for the vast majority of us, these examples of forgetting are completely normal. Why? Because while memory is amazing, it is far from perfect. Our brains aren't designed to remember every name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. Just because your memory sometimes fails doesn't mean it's broken or succumbing to disease. Forgetting is actually part of being human. In Remember, neuroscientist and acclaimed novelist Lisa Genova delves into how memories are made and how we retrieve them. You'll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily inaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for only a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your wedding day). You'll come to appreciate the clear distinction between normal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to Alzheimer's (that you own a car). And you'll see how memory is profoundly impacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. Once you understand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible strengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and potential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember and feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. You can set educated expectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship with it. You don't have to fear it anymore. And that can be life-changing},

Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients--or that two judges in the same courthouse give markedly different sentences to people who have committed the same crime. Suppose that different interviewers at the same firm make different decisions about indistinguishable job applicants--or that when a company is handling customer complaints, the resolution depends on who happens to answer the phone. Now imagine that the same doctor, the same judge, the same interviewer, or the same customer service agent makes different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical. In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein show the detrimental effects of noise in many fields, including medicine, law, economic forecasting, forensic science, bail, child protection, strategy, performance reviews, and personnel selection. Wherever there is judgment, there is noise. Yet, most of the time, individuals and organizations alike are unaware of it. They neglect noise. With a few simple remedies, people can reduce both noise and bias, and so make far better decisions. Packed with original ideas, and offering the same kinds of research-based insights that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge groundbreaking New York Times bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment--and what we can do about it},

  abstract = {Adaptive expertise encompasses efficiency and innovation; however little is known about the state of research of adaptive expertise in medical education. Our scoping review summarizes existing evidence in the conceptual frameworks, development, and measurement for adaptive expertise. We searched Pubmed, MEDLINE, ERIC, CINAHL and PsycINFO for original research articles published from 1986 onwards in English. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, no quantitative syntheses were conducted and the articles were summarized qualitatively. Of the 48 articles that met inclusion criteria, 19 examined conceptual frameworks, 24 explored interventions supporting development and 5 examined measurement. Conceptual frameworks are consistent within and beyond health professions education. Factors influencing development include: predisposing factors such as knowledge (ability to integrate knowledge and innovate), beliefs and attitudes (high motivation and humility), enabling factors such as skills (people skills, implementing reflection and scholarly activities), resources such as curricular enablers (providing variability of cases, allowing flexibility to generate solutions, critical appraisal of textbooks) and reinforcing factors such as mentor-guided feedback and constant curricular review. Two validated measurement tools exist for adaptive expertise. Substantial research opportunities exist in studying interventions involving the development of adaptive expertise. Notable gaps exist in the development and validation of measurement tools.},

The term "small teaching" refers to an approach that seeks to spark positive change in the classroom through small but powerful modifications to course design and teaching practices. A small teaching approach or activity may take one of three forms: brief classroom or online learning activities, one-time interventions in a course, or small modifications in course design or communication with students. Each chapter introduces a basic concept in cognitive research that has implications for classroom teaching, explains the rationale for offering it within a specific time period in a typical class, and then provides concrete examples of how this intervention has been used or could be used by faculty in a variety of disciplines.

  abstract = {Health systems invest significant resources in leadership development for physicians and other health professionals. Competent leadership is considered vital for maintaining and improving quality and patient safety. We carried out this systematic review to synthesise new empirical evidence regarding medical leadership development programme factors which are associated with outcomes at the clinical and organisational levels. Using Ovid MEDLINE, we conducted a database search using both free text and Medical Subject Headings. We then conducted an extensive hand-­ search of references and of citations in known healthcare leadership development reviews. We applied the Medical Education Research Study Quality Indicator (MERSQI) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool to determine study reliability, and synthesised results using a meta-­ aggregation approach. 117 studies were included in this systematic review. 28 studies met criteria for higher reliability studies. The median critical appraisal score according to the MERSQI was 8.5/18 and the median critical appraisal score according to the JBI was 3/10. There were recurring causes of low study quality scores related to study design, data analysis and reporting. There was considerable heterogeneity in intervention design and evaluation design. Programmes with internal or mixed faculty were significantly more likely to report organisational outcomes than programmes with external faculty only (p=0.049). Project work and mentoring increased the likelihood of organisational outcomes. No leadership development content area was particularly associated with organisational outcomes. In leadership development programmes in healthcare, external faculty should be used to supplement in-­ house faculty and not be a replacement for in-­house expertise. To facilitate organisational outcomes, interventions should include project work and mentoring. Educational methods appear to be more important for organisational outcomes than specific curriculum content. Improving evaluation design will allow educators and evaluators to more effectively understand factors which are reliably associated with organisational outcomes of leadership development.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects an asynchronous interprofessional education (IPE) activity had on graduate healthcare students’ beliefs regarding IPE, as measured by the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). Methods: All first-year physician assistant and physical therapy students participated in a collaborative four-week online case discussion. Students who consented to participate in the research component filled out a pre- and post-activity RIPLS questionnaire. Responses were matched by an individualized, student-generated number to protect students’ identity. Only matched scores were analyzed. Results: The total score as well as the Teamwork and Professional Identity sub-scales were analyzed for pre-post changes using the paired t-test. The Roles and Responsibilities sub-scale was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, due to a non-normal data distribution. A significant change (a=0.05) in score was found only in the Roles and Responsibilities sub-scale. Secondary outcomes indicate that a high proportion of the students felt the objectives of the activity were met. Conclusions: Significant changes were found on only one sub-scale of the RIPLS. Therefore, asynchronous IPE delivery does not change graduate healthcare students’ readiness for IPE. The participants felt the activity met its objectives, which indicates that asynchronous IPE delivery may be a viable technique in this population. Future studies should examine the difference between asynchronous and live IPE on the outcomes noted in this pilot study.},

  abstract = {Background: Learning engagement, motivation and academic achievement are vital grow­ ing areas in academic research. Evidence suggests that students’ engagement and motivation are positively linked to improved quality of learning. However, limited number of research studies have been conducted within this scope. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship of learning engagement, motivation and academic performance among university nursing students. Participants and Methods: A descriptive design, with a comparative correlational approach for data analysis, was used to describe and compare study outcomes. Data was collected from 425 students at King Saud bin Abdul-Aziz University for Health Sciences campuses in Riyadh, Jeddah and Alhasa. Study instruments included background data sheet, students’ engagement in schools (SESQ-ENG), engagement facilitators (SEI), academic motivation (AMS), and academic achievement as measured by cumulative and last semester grade point average (cGPA, sGPA). Results: Overall, level of engagement was moderate (mean = 3.70±0.63) with significant differences among campuses (F = 18.88, p≤001). Students’ perceptions of engagement facil­ itators and academic motivation were high (mean= 2.98 ±0.49, 4.89 ±1.03, respectively), and both varied by campus (F=6.35, p=0.002, F=9.85, p≤.001, respectively). Engagement, motiva­ tion, and academic achievement showed medium to large correlations (i.e., between 0.20 and 0.63). Multiple regression equation including age, academic progress, academic engagement, motivation and engagement facilitators significantly explained 24\% of variance in cGPA (F (5, 226) =14.209, p {$<$} 0.001) and 22\% of the variance in sGPA (F (5, 214) = 12.202, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: This study showed significant associations of students’ engagement, facil­ itating conditions (e.g., engagement-fostering aspects), and students’ motivation with significant effect on academic achievement. It is hoped that findings of this study could be used as quality indicators to direct school efforts towards achieving excellence in nursing education.},

Under this regime, when most assignments are posted and submitted online, it is possible to know if a student is missing a submission for an imminent deadline, and to intervene proactively to reduce missed assignments and improve student outcomes. Toward this goal, we designed and evaluated a scalable targeted intervention: a mobile app that would deploy push notifications when students were missing submissions for assignments with imminent deadlines. Results from two experimental pilots demonstrate that this intervention system significantly decreased missed assignments compared with control notifications about instructor announcements to the class (in Experiment 1), and improved assignment adherence and course grades compared with courses that were not using the app (in Experiment 2). In this article, we discuss the benefits and theoretical implications of this behavioral guide rail, a purely informative proactive intervention to mitigate risk in advance of a negative outcome.

It helps to conduct a comprehensive analysis of such behaviors and explore various learning patterns for learners and predict their performance by MOOC courses video. This paper exploits a temporal sequential classification problem by analyzing video clickstream data and predict learner performance, which is a vital decision-making problem, by addressing their issues and improving the educational process. This paper employs a deep neural network (LSTM) on a set of implicit features extracted from video clickstreams data to predict learners’ weekly performance and enable instructors to set measures for timely intervention. Results show that accuracy rate of the proposed model is 82\%–93\% throughout course weeks. The proposed LSTM model outperforms baseline ANNs, Super Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression by an accuracy of 93\% in real used courses’ datasets.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the reliability of learning trajectories and patterns of learning progression that can support meaningful intervention and remediation for residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This national retrospective cohort study included Milestones data from residents in family medicine, representing 6 semi-annual reporting periods from July 2016 to June 2019. INTERVENTIONS Longitudinal formative assessment using the Milestones assessment system reported to the ACGME. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES To estimate longitudinal consistency, growth rate reliability (GRR) and growth curve reliability (GCR) for 22 subcompetencies in the ACGME family medicine Milestones were used, incorporating clustering effects at the program level. Latent class growth curve models were used to examine longitudinal learning trajectories. RESULTS This study included Milestones ratings from 3872 residents in 514 programs. The Milestones reporting system reliably differentiated individual longitudinal patterns for formative purposes (mean [SD] GRR, 0.63 [0.03]); there was also evidence of precision for model-based rates of change (mean [SD] GCR, 0.91 [0.02]). Milestones ratings increased significantly across training years and reporting periods (mean [SD] of 0.55 [0.04] Milestones units per reporting period; P {$<$} .001); patterns of developmental progress varied by subcompetency. There were 3 or 4 distinct patterns of learning trajectories for each of the 22 subcompetencies. For example, for the professionalism subcompetency, residents were classified to 4 groups of learning trajectories; during the 3-year family medicine training period, trajectories diverged further after postgraduate year (PGY) 1, indicating a potential remediation point between the end of PGY 1 and the beginning of PGY 2 for struggling learners, who represented 16\% of learners (620 residents). Similar inferences for learning trajectories were found for practice-based learning and improvement, systems-based practice, and interpersonal and communication skills. Subcompetencies in medical knowledge and patient care demonstrated more consistent patterns of upward growth. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that the Milestones reporting system provides reliable longitudinal data for individualized tracking of progress in all subcompetencies.},

These days, there is increasing reliance on technology to support this in the classroom; one such technology is a student response system or its more recent development of this, that is, a game-based one. This study investigates the potential of using game-based student response systems for formative assessment through the analysis of learning outcomes and students’ perceptions of the gamified experience in terms of engagement and pleasantness. A quasi-experiment was conducted within an undergraduate course on educational technologies, involving about 400 students. Learning improvements were measured through a pre- and posttest, and students’ perceptions were elicited through a questionnaire. Data analysis showed a high level of student satisfaction and an overall improvement of learning outcomes due to the use of game-based student response systems. However, differences in terms of effectiveness were found according to the nature of the topics dealt with in the course, that is, whether or not they were used in the development of theoretical knowledge rather than the use of that knowledge in a more practical context.},

Methods: Search terms were identified from abstracts of reviews published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the titles of articles indexed as systematic reviews in PubMed. Both the precision of the candidate terms and the number of systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed were evaluated after excluding the subset of articles retrieved by the PubMed systematic review filter. Terms that achieved a precision greater than 70\% and relevant publication types indexed with MeSH terms were included in the filter search strategy. Results: The search strategy used in our filter added specific terms not included in PubMed’s systematic review filter and achieved a 61.3\% increase in the number of retrieved articles that are potential systematic reviews. Moreover, it achieved an average precision that is likely greater than 80\%. Conclusions: The developed search filter will enable users to identify more systematic reviews from PubMed than the PubMed systematic review filter with high precision.},

  abstract = {Objective:  to assess the evidence of validity and reliability of the academic motivation scale (AMS) based on the internal structure.  Method: this is a methodological study with 205 undergraduate nursing students. Dimensionality/internal structure of the AMS was assessed using factor analysis in the context of exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and reliability of the factors was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient and composite reliability (CR) coefficient.  Results: acceptable fit indexes were obtained (CFI = 0.92; RMSEA = 0.07; SRMR = 0.06) for a three-dimensional model: intrinsic motivation (10 items; α = 0.84; CR = 0.86); extrinsic motivation (8 items; α = 0.84; CR = 0.90); and demotivation (4 items; α = 0.84; CR = 0.88). A significant correlational pattern was found for the motivation continuum.  Conclusion: the dimensionality analysis for the AMS presented a model with three factors: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and demotivation, and was considered a reduced alternative to the original version of seven factors. This study helped assess the validity of the measurement instrument and its theory refinement; further studies should be conducted to assess its invariance property.           ,              Objetivo: avaliar as evidências de validade e a confiabilidade da Escala de Motivação Acadêmica (EMA) com base na estrutura interna.  Método: pesquisa metodológica realizada com 205 estudantes de graduação em Enfermagem. A dimensionalidade/estrutura interna da EMA foi avaliada por meio de análises fatoriais, no contexto de Modelagens de Equações Estruturais Exploratórias (ESEM) e a confiabilidade dos fatores foi aferida pelos coeficientes alfa de Cronbach (α) e Confiabilidade Composta (CC).  Resultados: foram obtidos índices de ajuste aceitáveis (CFI = 0,92; RMSEA = 0,07; SRMR = 0,06) para um modelo tridimensional: Motivação Intrínseca (10 itens; α = 0,84; CC = 0,86); Motivação Extrínseca (08 itens; α = 0,84; CC = 0,90); e Desmotivação (04 itens; α = 0,84; CC = 0,88). Encontrou-se padrão correlacional significativo para o continuum de motivação.  Conclusão: a análise da dimensionalidade da EMA alcançou um modelo de três fatores: Motivação Intrínseca, Motivação Extrínseca e Desmotivação, sendo considerada uma alternativa parcimoniosa à versão original de sete fatores. Este estudo contribuiu para a avaliação da validade do instrumento de medida e seu refinamento teórico, apontando a necessidade de que investigações futuras avaliem sua propriedade de invariância.           ,              Objetivo: evaluar las evidencias de validez y confiabilidad de la Escala de Motivación Académica (EMA) en base a la estructura interna.

The gamification literature and the use of gamification in practice suggest that gamification can be a useful tool to support behavioral and psychological changes. Recent developments show that there is potential for new waves of gamification research. Therefore, we conducted a workshop at the International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik (WI) 2021 to discuss the future of gamification with interested scholars. The discussion with 25 gamification experts led to a research agenda that supports the need for adaptive and personalized gamification designs. Together with the experts, we identify three clusters for future research: 1) the personalization of gamification concepts, 2) theories and concepts for gamified human-computer interaction, and 3) the “dark side” of gamification (e.g., addiction). We also address what the gamification concept means. Aligned with the three clusters, we provide valuable starting points for future research inquiries to help researchers better understand the nature of gamification. We also discuss the capabilities and limits of gamification.},

  abstract = {Gamification refers to using game attributes in a non-gaming context. Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students’ learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.},

Both medicine and higher education face the challenge of adapting CBE programs for learners who begin the program with different configurations of knowledge and skillsets and learn at different rates. Additional challenges include, but are not limited to standard setting, time variability within programs for student learning, defining competencies, and training faculty to develop and assess CBE programs. This article argues there is much higher education programs can learn about defining competencies, assessing performance, and curriculum design by understanding how CBE is implemented in medical education. We also provide an overview of how CBE in medical education (CBE-­ME) has evolved compared to CBE in higher education (CBE-­HE), including examples of how medical education has addressed defining competency issues, assessing competence, and standard setting.},

  abstract = {Background: Spirituality is a fundamental dimension of our human nature that impacts on medical care and yet is relatively neglected by medical education courses in Australia. Aim: This systematic review was conducted to assess the curriculum content currently used to develop medical student understanding of, and engagement with, spirituality in the context of patient care. Methods: Studies published in English from 2010 to the review date were included in order to focus on the most recent curricula. Studies included medical students in undergraduate or postgraduate programmes, doctors in resident training programmes and registrars. Interventions considered for inclusion were curriculum modules on communication skills in spirituality, spiritual needs assessments and holistic care planning. Six databases, including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Embase, Medline and CINAHL, were searched electronically using the following keywords and MeSH search terms: ‘medical students’, ‘doctor‘, ‘physician’, ‘spirituality’, ‘spiritual care’, ‘religion’, ‘education’, ‘history taking’ and ‘communication skills training’ from 2010 to 2020. Results: For 342 articles, three researchers screened the titles and abstracts; disagreements were resolved by discussion. Full-text articles were assessed for eligibility based on study and report characteristics; 17 papers were included in the analysis. Curriculum content of each study was reviewed. The following key features were employed frequently: chaplain shadowing, communications skills training, self-reflection, examining evidence and relationship building. Conclusion: This review has determined the core content, aims and objectives to guide construction of spirituality curricula in Australian medical education.},

  abstract = {Despite its recognized importance for academic success, much of the research investigating time management has proceeded without regard to a comprehensive theoretical model for understanding its connections to students’ engagement, learning, or achievement. Our central argument is that self-regulated learning provides the rich conceptual framework necessary for understanding college students’ time management and for guiding research examining its relationship to their academic success. We advance this larger purpose through four major sections. We begin by describing work supporting the significance of time management within post-secondary contexts. Next, we review the limited empirical findings linking time management and the motivational and strategic processes viewed as central to self-regulated learning. We then evaluate conceptual ties between time management and processes critical to the forethought, performance, and post-performance phases of self-regulated learning. Finally, we discuss commonalities in the antecedents and contextual determinants of self-regulated learning and time management. Throughout these sections, we identify avenues of research that would contribute to a greater understanding of time management and its fit within the framework of selfregulated learning. Together, these efforts demonstrate that time management is a significant self-regulatory process through which students actively manage when and for how long they engage in the activities deemed necessary for reaching their academic goals.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning (SDL) is encouraged in professional education because it nurtures students' self-motivation and promotes accountability to their own learning. SDL is crucial to fostering collaborative skills for multi-disciplinary practice in today's healthcare settings. Objective: To identify factors associated with SDL ability among undergraduate nursing students. Design: A systematic review was conducted. Methods: The PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) strategy was used as a guide. Searches were done of studies published between May 2010 and April 2020 via MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE, as well as print. Screening, selection, and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. All discrep­ ancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. Result: A total of 18 of 1576 articles were selected based on the PRISMA process. The methodological quality of all included studies was mostly moderate. Factors associated with SDL were identified from both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Upon the integration of all evidence, the results showed that SDL is developed with the interaction environmental influence (types of study programmes, study years, and teaching-learning strategies) and personal influence [personal characteristics (age and gender) and learning attributes (problem-solving ability, self-efficacy, learning attitude and learning interest). Strategies employing individual study and small group learning with adequate support by educators exert a great deal of positive effect on SDL improvement. Conclusion: All identified factors improve students' SDL. The results of the review revealed SDL development with the interaction of environmental/situation influence and personal influence. Nurse educators should be more aware of the effects of these factors on SDL development during different stages of study. Strategies with in­ dependent learning and small group learning are effective to enhance students' learning attributes. Importantly, continuous support and guidance provided by educators is crucial to achieve students' SDL enhancement for lifelong learning during study.},

One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers". The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and other knowledge workers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking technique: the Zettelkasten. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for your notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. Dr. Sönke Ahrens is a writer and researcher in the field of education and social science. He is the author of the award-winning book “Experiment and Exploration: Forms of World Disclosure” (Springer). Since its first publication, How to Take Smart Notes has sold more than 100,000 copies and has been translated into seven languages},

Parents were provided with books and encouraged to have their children read with them regularly. Children's writing skills at the word, sentence, and text levels were measured at the end of the intervention. In addition to the previously reported effects on children's reading skills, the current analysis found that the shared-reading intervention also had effects on the children's gains in writing skills at the sentence and text levels.

Issue Addressed               The aim of this article is to describe how experiential learning, authentic assessments, community development and ethical principles were consolidated in the design and delivery of a health promotion planning and evaluation subject (HPE) during 2019 to 2021. Experiential learning and authentic assessments were used to guide the development of health promotion competencies in line with the International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) Core Competencies and Professional Standards for Health Promotion. Students were required to complete three sequential authentic assessments. Ethics approval was granted for students to undertake a needs/assets assessment with a local community group following which, students completed a literature review and planned a community development program.                                         Methods               The subject comprises 10\,h of weekly engagement over a 12‐week semester with weekly topics following a program logic model. Working in teams and individually, students work with a local community group to assess their needs/assets and establish priority areas regarding health and wellbeing. This then informed the development of a health promotion program and evaluation plan. Students undertook three sequential authentic assessment tasks: (i) needs/assets report, (ii) a literature review and (iii) a program folio. Retrospective anonymous student feedback on subject (SFS) data from 2019 to 2021 was used to evaluate HPE.                                         Results and Discussion               HPE provides students with the opportunity to understand ethical principles and processes, engage with stakeholders in the community and develop qualitative research skills, to plan and evaluate health promotion programs. SFS scores have improved with an overall score of 3.7 (response rate 49.44\%) in 2019 to 4.3 (response rate 39.58\%) in 2020 and 4.04 (response rate 28.57\%) in 2021.                                         Conclusion               Students acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills in line with IUHPE Core Competency and Professional Standards for Health Promotion preparing them for their future professional practice.                                         So what?               These teaching and learning experiences show that students can develop health promotion competencies through sound pedagogical approaches, both online and face‐to‐face and in challenging environments.},

Thus, the effectiveness of the lecture depends on the students’ preparation. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become difficult to examine student preparations and to predict student course failures with limiting variables. Learning analytics can overcome this limitation. In this study, we aimed to develop a predictive model for at-risk students who are at risk of failing their final exam in an introductory anatomy course. In a five-week online flipped anatomy course, students’ weekly interaction metrics, quiz scores, and pretest scores were used to design a predictive model. We also compared the performances of different machine learning algorithms. According to the results, the Naïve Bayes algorithm showed the best performance for predicting student grades with an overall classification accuracy of 68\% and with at-risk prediction accuracy of 71\%. These results can be used as a traffic light project wherein the “at-risk” group will receive the red light, and thus, will require more effort to engage with the content and they might need to solve the quiz tests after an individual study period.},

  abstract = {Objective. Learning management system (LMS) data from online classes may provide opportunities to identify students at risk of failure. Previous LMS studies have not addressed the possibility of change in student engagement over time. The purpose of this study was to apply a novel statistical technique, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to LMS data in an online course to identify predictors of successful course completion. Methods. Exploratory GBTM was used to assess the association of LMS activity (total activity time, dates of activity, and pages viewed) and attendance at virtual synchronous learning sessions with examination performance in a capstone disease-management course delivered in the final didactic quarter of a three-year Doctor of Pharmacy program. Groups were assigned based on trajectories of weekly page view counts using structural-equation modeling. Results. Group-based trajectory modeling identified three page view engagement groups (median total page views, n): group 1, high (1,818, n524): group 2, moderate (1,029, n574), and group 3, low (441 views, n535). Group assignment alone was somewhat associated with final grade. Stratification based on consistent virtual synchronous learning session attendance improved predictive accuracy; for example, a top (A or A-) grade was earned by 49.0\% and 24.0\%, respectively, of group 2 students with and without consistent synchronous engagement. Conclusion. Application of GBTM to LMS data, including information about synchronous engagement, could provide data that allow educators to identify early warning signs that a student may fail a course and target interventions to those at-risk students. The technique should be further tested with alternative LMS data and obtained early in the didactic curriculum, before patterns of engagement are established.},

This study assessed the efficacy of FC combined with case-based learning (CBL) in undergraduate pathology education via comparison with a traditional lecture-based classroom (LBC).A total of 117 third-year students were enrolled and assigned to the FC group (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}59) or LBC group (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}58) with demographic matches. Two sections in the pathology textbook (cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases) were chosen for the teaching content. Students in the FC group were required to study the preprovided course materials pre-class, followed by clinical case-based interactive group discussion in-class. Students in the LBC group were encouraged to preview and attended a didactic lecture in class. Post-class quizzes and Likert questionnaires were performed to investigate the efficacy and possible advantages of CBL-based FC over LBC.The scores of the 2 groups in the mid-term examination of pathology before interventions were comparable. However, students in the FC group gained significantly higher scores in the post-quizzes than those in the LBC group, especially the scores regarding the questions of clinical case analysis. In the questionnaires, more students considered CBL-based FC to be beneficial to learning motivation, knowledge comprehension, critical thinking, patient management and teamwork than LBC. In addition, more students agreed that the FC model increased pre-class burden than LBC, rather than in-class pressure.CBL-based FC modality has promising effects on undergraduate pathology education and may be a better choice than traditional LBC. Further optimizations are needed to implement this novel approach in pathology and other medicine curricula.},

The results suggested that digital support strategies better satisfied students’ needs, that all of the needs were predictors of the level of engagement, and that relatedness support was very important.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The education system has shifted from traditional to online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the Learning Management System (LMS) is one of the most important and comprehensive learning platforms that support and facilitate online learning during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the perceived system usability of LMS during the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Task-Technology Fit (TTF), and System Usability Scale (SUS). METHODS: An online survey was utilized to collect data from 502 Filipino students from different academic institutions and different areas of study. RESULTS: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that students’ perceived ease of use of LMS had a significant effect on perceived usefulness which subsequently and positively led to students’ perceived satisfaction of LMS. In addition, LMS technology characteristics was found to have a significant effect on LMS task-technology fit which subsequently led to perceived usefulness and perceived satisfaction. Interestingly, perceived satisfaction was found to have a significant effect on students’ perceived system usability of LMS which was calculated using a System Usability Scale (SUS). CONCLUSION: The findings have implications within the education system globally, particularly in recognizing the relevance of LMS moving forward. Furthermore, since this is the first study that integrated SUS, TAM, and TTF, the conceptual framework can be utilized to evaluate the perceived usability of LMS worldwide.},

  abstract = {Online learning is extremely prevalent in education, more than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic that has shifted most educational services to an online platform. More specifically, in 2015, close to six million students were taking at least one online learning course, which was 29.7\% of all postsecondary students (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics 2018). In 2017, the Online Learning Consortium reported an almost 4\% increase in online learning students in 2015 as compared to the previous two years. Although online learning is becoming more prevalent, there has been little to no research to determine what makes online learning most effective. Those that have, either have not compared modalities (i.e., only testing one format) (Sella et al. 2014; Walker and Rehfeldt 2012) or have focused on another aspect of the learning (e.g., does grading anonymously affect performance) (Liu et al. 2018). Determining the components of online learning that lead to better student outcomes will add to the current literature and improve online learning as a whole. The primary purpose of this experiment was to determine what forms of discussion (synchronous vs asynchronous) are most effective in an asynchronous online master-level applied behavior analysis course.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} The Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) is widely used in online teaching and learning, especially in STEM education. However, educational research on using Moodle is scattered throughout the literature. Therefore, this review aims to summarise this research to assist three sets of stakeholders—educators, researchers, and software developers. It identifies: (a) how and where Moodle has been adopted; (b) what the concerns, trends, and gaps are to lead future research and software development; and (c) innovative and effective methods for improving online teaching and learning. The review used the 4-step PRISMA-P process to identify 155 suitable journal articles from 104 journals in 55 countries published from January 2015 to June 2021. The database search was conducted with Scopus and Web of Science. Insights into the educational use of Moodle were determined through bibliometric analysis with Vosviewer outputs and thematic analysis. Results:\enspace{} This review shows that Moodle is mainly used within University STEM disciplines and effectively improves student performance, satisfaction, and engagement. Moodle is increasingly being used as a platform for adaptive and collaborative learning and used to improve online assessments. The use of Moodle is developing rapidly to address academic integrity, ethics, and security issues to enhance speed and navigation, and incorporate artificial intelligence. Conclusion:\enspace{} More qualitative research is required on the use of Moodle, particularly investigating educators’ perspectives. Further research is also needed on the use of Moodle in non-STEM and non-tertiary disciplines. Further studies need to incorporate educational theories when designing courses using the Moodle platform.},

Four of these are presented in this chapter, 1. LA as a concern or problem to be solved, 2. LA as an opportunity, 3. LA as field of inquiry and 4. the researchers and practitioners that make up the LA community. These four ways of understanding LA and its associated constructs, technologies, domains and history can hopefully provide a launch pad not only for the other chapters in this handbook but the world of LA in general.

Methods: The intervention was delivered to 10 students and writing proficiency was assessed over five semesters. Overall doctoral project quality and rigor were assessed at the end of the program and compared to a similar group of students (n = 20). Seven faculty and eight students participated in qualitative interviews. Results: Performance improved from Semesters 1 to 5; and though quality and rigor did not differ, the inter­ vention group's final papers were more efficiently written with approximately 17 fewer pages and an average review time of eight fewer minutes than the comparison group. Participants identified the rubric, feedback, and scaffolding as helpful program components. Conclusions: Scientific writing development is essential to DNP education.

  abstract = {Purpose               Research methodologies represent assumptions about knowledge and ways of knowing. Diverse research methodologies and methodological standards for rigor are essential in shaping the collective set of knowledge in health professions education (HPE). Given this relationship between methodologies and knowledge, it is important to understand the breadth of research methodologies and their rigor in HPE research publications. However, there are limited studies examining these questions. This study synthesized current trends in methodologies and rigor in HPE papers to inform how evidence is gathered and collectively shapes knowledge in HPE.                                         Method               This descriptive quantitative study used stepwise stratified cluster random sampling to analyze 90 papers from 15 HPE journals published in 2018 and 2019. Using a research design codebook, the authors conducted group coding processes for fidelity, response process validity, and rater agreement; an index quantifying methodological rigor was developed and applied for each paper.                                         Results               Over half of research methodologies were quantitative (51\%), followed by qualitative (28\%), and mixed methods (20\%). No quantitative and mixed methods papers reported an epistemological approach. All qualitative papers that reported an epistemological approach (48\%) used social constructivism. Most papers included participants from North America (49\%) and Europe (20\%). The majority of papers did not specify participant sampling strategies (56\%) or a rationale for sample size (80\%). Among those reported, most studies (81\%) collected data within 1 year.               The average rigor score of the papers was 56\% (SD = 17). Rigor scores varied by journal categories and research methodologies. Rigor scores differed between general HPE journals and discipline-specific journals. Qualitative papers had significantly higher rigor scores than quantitative and mixed methods papers.                                         Conclusions               This review of methodological breadth and rigor in HPE papers raises awareness in addressing methodological gaps and calls for future research on how the authors shape the nature of knowledge in HPE.},

However, the skills of effective peer review are rarely taught. In the adolescent field of medical education research, peer review is especially important to advance the scientific rigor of the field. From our experience reviewing biomedical and medical education research, we have found that a thorough review takes multiple readings and multiple hours. The first reading provides a general overview of the aims and methods. Subsequent readings focus on the details of the methodology, results, and interpretation. The written review should provide firm but gentle feedback that the authors can use to improve their work, even if we have recommended rejection for this submission. We hope that this description of our process for reviewing a medical education research manuscript will assist others and thereby advance the quality of publications in our field.},

This paper aims to develop a theoretic framework for the diagonal approach. The framework is articulated through integer programming, maximizing health benefits given constraints by identifying the optimal set of both vertical and horizontal interventions to fund.},

Self-regulation skills notably affect students’ efficacy when studying and academic performance, for better or worse. However, neither students or instructors generally have proper understanding of what self-regulated learning is, the impact that it has or how to assess it. This paper has the purpose of showing how learning analytics can be used in order to generate simple metrics related to several areas of students’ selfregulation, in the context of a first-year university course. These metrics are based on data obtained from a learning management system, complemented by more specific assessment-related data and direct answers to self-regulated learning questionnaires. As the end result, simple self-regulation profiles are obtained for each student, which can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses and, potentially, help struggling students to improve their learning habits.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gamification of learning is a novel pedagogical approach in education, and Kahoot is one of the game-based learning platforms widely used for formative assessments in real-time. This study aimed to explore the medical students' perception of using Kahoot in remote learning. METHODS: The mixed-method study was carried out among 72 medical students (in third-year) at Eastern University, Sri Lanka, following a formative assessment on immunology conducted via zoom video conferencing and Kahoot. The students' perception was collected through a google form, which consisted of 13 statements with a 5-point Likert scale and an open-ended question. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney test were computed using SPSS ver. 25. A content analysis was employed to interpret the qualitative statements. RESULTS: The participants' age ranges from 23-28 years with male-female ratio of 1:1.57. The majority of the students felt happy (73.6\%) while playing Kahoot remotely and recommended it (84.7\%) for formative assessment in future. The participants agreed that Kahoot increased the focus, understanding of the subject, helped retain knowledge, motivated them to learn, provided fun during learning, and kept them active throughout. The majority of the participants agreed that Kahoot was an effective tool for distance learning. Internet connectivity and switching between two applications were identified as difficulties while playing remote mode Kahoot quizzes. CONCLUSION: The online gaming platform Kahoot has a positive impact on learning immunology. Kahoot maintains its fun and enjoyable nature and motivates students to learn during remote teaching of immunology.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} The National Benchmark Test (NBT) that determines academic readiness is widely used by Faculties as an additional measure to select students for the study of medicine. Despite this, many students continue to experience academic challenges that culminate in delayed graduation and sometimes academic exclusion or discontinuation of studies. Aim:\enspace{} This study aimed to understand academic and non-academic variables linked with academic difficulties in the first three years of medical education. Methods:\enspace{} The study sample consisted of six cohorts of medical students for the period 2011 to 2016 (n\,=\,1392). Only the first three of the six-year medical programme were selected for analysis. Survival analysis and Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) was used to identify academic and non-academic variables associated with academic difficulties. Results:\enspace{} A total of 475 students (34\%) experienced academic difficulty; 221 (16\%) in the first year of study, 192 (14\%) in the second year and 62 (5\%) in the third year of study. The results show that Intermediate Upper, Lower and Basic levels for all NBT domains, living in university residence, rurality and male gender were risk factors for academic difficulty. Conclusion:\enspace{} In mitigating these factors, the NBT must inform the type of support programmes to augment the students’ skills and promote academic success. Additionally, existing support programmes should be evaluated to ascertain if they reach students at risk and whether participating in these programmes yield positive academic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background:               A proportion of manuscripts submitted to scientific journals get rejected, for varied reasons. A systematic analysis of the reasons for rejection will be relevant to editors, reviewers, and prospective authors. We aimed to analyze the reasons for rejection of manuscripts submitted to the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, the flagship journal of Indian Psychiatric Society South Zonal Branch.                                         Methods:               We performed a content analysis of the rejection reports of all the articles submitted to the journal between January 1, 2018, and May 15, 2020. Rejection reports were extracted from the manuscript management website and divided into three types: desk rejections, post-peer-review rejections, and post-editorial-re-review rejections. They were analyzed separately for the rejection reasons, using a predefined coding frame.                                         Results:               A total of 898 rejection reports were available for content analysis. Rejection was a common fate for manuscripts across the types of submission; figures ranged from 26.7\% for viewpoint articles to 72.1\% for review articles. The median time to desk rejection was 3 days, while the median time to post-peer-review rejection and post-editorial-re-review rejection was 42 days and 96 days, respectively. The most common reasons for desk rejection were lack of novelty or being out of the journal’s scope. Inappropriate study designs, poor methodological descriptions, poor quality of writing, and weak study rationale were the most common rejection reasons mentioned by both peer reviewers and editorial re-reviewers.                                         Conclusions:               Common reasons for rejection included poor methodology and poorly written manuscripts. Prospective authors should pay adequate attention to conceptualization, design, and presentation of their study, apart from selecting an appropriate journal, to avoid rejection and enhance their manuscript’s chances of publication.},

Five hundred and ninety-six Peruvian university students participated in their first to tenth semesters on campuses in Lima, Trujillo, and Cajamarca. Nonparametric scalability, dimensionality, reliability (score and item levels), and latent invariance were analyzed. The results showed that reducing the number of response options was necessary. Reducing the number of items also produced better scaling. Two slightly related dimensions were strong internal validity and acceptable item reliability; furthermore, reliability was adequate. Age and gender had trivial correlations in item variability. Finally, differences between the semesters were obtained in the means, variances, and latent correlations. In conclusion, we propose a better definition of the constructs of autonomy and control measured by the SRQ-L. This article also discusses the limitations and implications of the study.},

Varieties of learning Management System (LMS) were developed by respective universities and software companies to assist the learning process. In Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), UFuture platform is developed to assist in the teaching and learning process. However, there is little information on the user experience (UX) among the students interacting with UFuture. This paper attempt to address the user experience of UFuture usage. The data were gathered from a focus group study consists of 50 postgraduate students that has experiences using UFuture platform for learning. The study used a standard User Experiences Questionnaire (UEQ) comprised of 26 questions in measuring six (6) scales which are Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty. The descriptive analysis result indicates neutral evaluation, where the mean values of each scale within -0.8 to 0.8. In addition, the benchmarking between UiTM UFuture against UEQ dataset shows that the learning platform scored “below average”. For future work it is suggested, element of attractiveness, efficiency, stimulation and dependability of UFuture platform should be enhanced to heighten the overall student’s user experience (UX).},

  abstract = {A primary advantage of healthcare simulation as a teaching and learning method is its experiential nature, as well as the interactive ability to be more learner-centered than traditional methods. Based on the author’s observation of music education, the concepts presented in this article aims to challenge simulationists to be even more experiential, relational, and learner-centered, including ways to create immediate and sustained psychological safety. This article advocates for the addition of brief steps and new ways of facilitating simulation to our general simulation practice today. Adding these elements to our education may increase learning outcomes, engagement, and motivation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Reports have forecast significant changes ahead for Continuing Professional Development (CPD). With new models on the horizon, CPD developers will require additional knowledge and training. Our objective was to learn how CPD leaders and developers came into their roles, if they are engaged in scholarship and the challenges and opportunities in pursuing scholarship. Methods: We conducted a mixed grounded theory study, inviting CPD leaders within our institution for interviews focused on career paths, CPD and scholarly activities, networks, and supports and challenges. We invited 405 program/conference directors from our institution to participate in a survey focused on similar themes. We used the framework of ontological choreography in our final analysis. Results: We conducted 13 interviews and had a survey response rate of 28.6\% (n = 116). We identified three themes: (1) the pathway to becoming an expert in CPD planning and delivery is often unplanned, unclear, and uncredentialed; (2) CPD is undervalued as a field, with inadequate time and funding allocated; and (3) engagement with scholarship is variable while identifying resources to support scholarship is difficult. Discussion: Beyond the usual calls for CPD to be more appropriately recognized and valued, this article offers another way to explore why past visions of the future have not been fully realized; CPD means different things to different people; it is ontologically different even across a single network in a single faculty.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} Struggling at medical school incorporates academic failure, course disruption and early course exit. Struggling is usually multi-factorial involving academic, personal, financial and health factors. Struggling students may fail to engage with available support. First year students are particularly susceptible as they transition to university and a professional career. Methods:\enspace{} The study aim was to explore medical students’ own voices on struggling and assess how they match up to existing literature. During one academic year, all first year medical students at the University of Birmingham (UK) who opted to leave or were required to withdraw (n\,=\,52) were asked to participate in an individual exit interview. Fifteen students responded and fourteen (27\%) agreed to be interviewed. Interviews were face to face (n\,=\,10), telephone (n\,=\,3) and via email (n\,=\,1). Interviews were unstructured and led by a general open question. Framework analysis identified key data themes. Results:\enspace{} Students described year one of medical school as a critical transition. They simultaneously needed to adapt to being a university student, a medical student and a doctor. A six-group typology of students emerged, each of which struggled with one or more of these adaptations. The groups were: wrong degree choice, mental health problems, acute crisis, at capacity, slow starter and family rock. Some students experienced an isolated problem from within this typology. Most had a multi-factorial story of struggling. Mental health problems and acute crises were the most common issues. Early professional identity formation was a key hurdle. Help-seeking behaviours were varied. Conclusions:\enspace{} This study explores the narratives of medical students who struggled from an early stage and presents a data-driven typology of their issues. It advances existing qualitative understanding of this topic, which to date is predominantly derived from educator perceptions and not specific to early course issues. Although our results broadly cohere with existing knowledge, we also present novel findings which may reflect our focus on first year students. Issues around early professional identity formation may reflect the increasing emphasis on professionalism in medical school curricula. Listening to these narratives could help university staff to identify students at risk of struggling for targeted support.},

  abstract = {Issue: Life-long learning is a skill that is central to competent health professionals, and medical educators have sought to understand how adult professionals learn, adapt to new information, and independently seek to learn more. Accrediting bodies now mandate that training programs teach in ways that promote self-directed learning (SDL) but do not provide adequate guidance on how to address this requirement. Evidence: The model for the SDL mandate in physician training is based mostly on early childhood and secondary education evidence and literature, and may not capture the unique environment of medical training and clinical education. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about how medical schools and postgraduate training programs should implement and evaluate SDL educational interventions. The Shapiro Institute for Education and Research, in conjunction with the Association of American Medical Colleges, convened teams from eight medical schools from North America to address the challenge of defining, implementing, and evaluating SDL and the structures needed to nurture and support its development in health professional training. Implications: In this commentary, the authors describe SDL in Medical Education, (SDL-ME), which is a construct of learning and pedagogy specific to medical students and physicians in training. SDL-ME builds on the foundations of SDL and self-regulated learning theory, but is specifically contextualized for the unique responsibilities of physicians to patients, inter-professional teams, and society. Through consensus, the authors offer suggestions for training programs to teach and evaluate SDL-ME. To teach self-directed learning requires placing the construct in the context of patient care and of an obligation to society at large. The SDL-ME construct builds upon SDL and SRL frameworks and suggests SDL as foundational to health professional identity formation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Literature suggests that the quality and rigor of health professions education (HPE) research can be elevated if the research is anchored in existing theories and frameworks. This critical skill is difficult for novice researchers to master. We created a workshop to introduce the practical application of theories and frameworks to HPE research. Methods: We conducted two 60- to 75-minute workshops, one in 2019 at an in-person national conference and another in 2021 during an online national education conference. After a brief role-play introduction, participants applied a relevant theory to a case scenario in small groups, led by facilitators with expertise in HPE research. The workshop concluded with a presentation on applying the lessons learned when preparing a scholarly manuscript. We conducted a postworkshop survey to measure self-reported achievement of objectives. Results: Fifty-five individuals participated in the in-person workshop, and approximately 150 people completed the online workshop. Sixty participants (30\%) completed the postworkshop survey across both workshops. As a result of participating in the workshop, 80\% of participants (32) indicated they could distinguish between frameworks and theories, and 86\% (32) could apply a conceptual or theoretical framework to a research question. Strengths of the workshop included the small-group activity, access to expert facilitators, and the materials provided. Discussion: The workshop has been well received by participants and fills a gap in the existing resources available to HPE researchers and mentors. It can be replicated in multiple settings to model the application of conceptual and theoretical frameworks to HPE research.},

But, then, in fifth grade, something happened to change his life: he discovered competitive debate. Immediately, he was hooked. It turned out, perhaps counterintuitively, that debating was the perfect activity for someone shy and unsure of himself. It became a way for Bo not only to find his voice, but to excel socially and academically. And he's not the only one. Far from it: presidents, Supreme Court justices, and CEOs are all disproportionally debaters. This is hardly a coincidence. By tracing his own journey from immigrant kid to world champion, Seo shows how the skills of debating-information gathering, truth finding, lucidity, organization, and persuasion-are often the cornerstone of successful careers and happy lives. Drawing insights from its strategies, structure, and history, Seo teaches readers the skills of competitive debate, and in doing so shows how they can improve their communication with friends, family, and colleagues alike. He takes readers on a thrilling intellectual adventure into the eccentric and brilliant subculture of competitive debate, touching on everything from the radical politics of Malcom X to Artificial Intelligence. Seo proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that, far from being a source of conflict, good-faith debate can enrich our daily lives and, indeed, is essential to a flourishing democracy"--},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic forced institutions of higher education around the world to quickly transition to forms of distance education, including synchronous and asynchronous online learning. Often lacking conceptual, empirical, and practical understanding of online pedagogy, many institutions have met this endeavor with mixed success. It seems inevitable that online learning will continue to play a key role in all sectors of education and, accordingly, that online pedagogy deserves a more mainstream focus. To help build a joint understanding of foundational knowledge between the online learning, educational technology, and educational psychology communities, in this article, we summarize the most frequently cited conceptual model that shapes research and practice in the field of higher education online learning: the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. We describe the original CoI model and its foundational components (i.e., cognitive, social, and teaching presence) and highlight opportunities for improvement of the model by incorporating the educational psychology and learning sciences research base to inform: (1) conceptualizations of the social dimensions of collaborative learning and (2) understanding of learner contributions to online collaborative education including self-, co-, and shared regulation of learning. We propose that a new, more comprehensive conceptualization of the regulation of collaborative online learning be integrated into the existing CoI framework and that a new “presence” be referenced going forward—“Learning Presence.” Through this work, we strive to develop a more nuanced, generative, and informed vision of the future of online learning informed by relevant contemporary conceptualizations in educational psychology.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in smart devices and online technologies have facilitated the emergence of ubiquitous learning environments for participating in different learning activities. This poses an interesting question about modality access, i.e., what students are using each platform for and at what time of day. In this paper, we present a log-based exploratory study on learning management system (LMS) use comparing three different modalities—computer, mobile, and tablet—based on the aspect of time. Our objective is to better understand how and to what extent learning sessions via mobiles and tablets occur at different times throughout the day compared to computer sessions. The complexity of the question is further intensified because learners rarely use a single modality for their learning activities but rather prefer a combination of two or more. Thus, we check the associations between patterns of modality usage and time of day as opposed to the counts of modality usage and time of day. The results indicate that computer-dominant learners are similar to limited-computer learners in terms of their session-time distribution, while intensive learners show completely different patterns. For all students, sessions on mobile devices are more frequent in the afternoon, while the proportion of computer sessions was higher at night. On comparison of these time-of-day preferences with respect to modalities on weekdays and weekends, they were found consistent for computer-dominant and limited-computer learners only. We demonstrate the implication of this research for enhancing contextual profiling and subsequently improving the personalization of learning systems such that personalized notification systems can be integrated with LMSs to deliver notifications to students at appropriate times.},

  abstract = {Predictions of the timelines for when machines will be able to perform general cognitive activities that rival humans, or even the arrival of “super intelligence”, range from years to decades to never. For researchers in the education sector, the potential future state of AI, while provocative, is secondary to important shorter-term questions that influence how AI is integrated into learning and knowledge practices such as sensemaking and decision making. AI is not a future technology. It is already present in our daily lives, often shaping, behind the scenes, the types of information we encounter. It is, therefore, important to consider immediate questions surrounding the dynamics of human-machine interactions. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between human and artificial cognition and treat these as separate systems, each with distinct strengths and capabilities. We adopt a functional view (i.e., discrete tasks) of the activities that artificial cognition completes and those that are best handled by humans. This creates a foundation to then evaluate models for how these two cognitive systems interact and the mechanisms for coordination that are required. In doing so, we create a basis for future researchers to develop testable hypotheses regarding the impact of artificial cognition on knowledge processes such as learning, sensemaking, and decision making. Our evaluation provides insight for researchers regarding the optimal relationship between which cognitive activities should be handed off to the machine, which should remain the domain of human performance, and how these two should then be integrated when outputs are passed from one cognitive system (human or artificial) to the other.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the psychometric properties of the Thai Mental Health Literacy Scale (TMHLS) in sixth-year medical students. Materials and Methods: By using the purposive sampling method, we enrolled 202 participants in this study. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data. The index of item-objective congruence (IOC) was used to verify content validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to establish the construct validity of the TMHLS. The internal consistency was estimated by computing Cronbach’s coefficient alpha. Results: The TMHLS had good content validity (IOC=.85) and construct validity. The EFA resulted in five factors, which included 32 of the 35 items and accounted for 46.86\% of the variance. The factors were the ability to recognize mental disorders; confidentiality of mental health practitioners; skills of mental health information seeking; beliefs about mental illnesses; and attitudes toward patients with mental illness. The reliability coefficient of the TMHLS total test was .851, and reliability coefficient in subdomains were range from .197 to .872. Individuals who had a mental health professional as an intimate contact and individuals who had a history of seeking help from mental health professional(s) in person showed significantly higher mental health literacy than those who did not. Conclusions: The TMHLS has good psychometric properties. Dynamic knowledge transfer and exchange with a close mental health professional should be applied to promote mental health literacy in medical students.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has been a major influence for the field of educational psychology. One of the main guidelines of the theory is that extraneous cognitive load should be reduced to leave sufficient cognitive resources for the actual learning to take place. In recent years, research regarding various design factors, in particular from the field of digital and online learning, have challenged this assumption. Interactive learning media, immersion, disfluency, realism, and redundant elements constitute five major challenges, since these design factors have been shown to induce task-irrelevant cognitive load, i.e., extraneous load, while still promoting motivation and learning. However, currently there is no unified approach to integrate such effects into cognitive load theory. By including aspects of constructive alignment, an approach aimed at fostering deep forms of learning in order to achieve specific learning outcomes, we devise a strategy to balance cognitive load in digital learning. Most importantly, we suggest considering both the positive and negative effects on cognitive load that certain design factors of digital learning can cause. In addition, a number of research results highlight that some types of positive effects of digital learning can only be detected using a suitable assessment method. This strategy of aligning cognitive load with desired learning outcomes will be useful for formulating theory-guided and empirically testable hypotheses, but can be particularly helpful for practitioners to embrace emerging technologies while minimizing potential extraneous drawbacks.},

  abstract = {The author was invited to write a commentary on the ethics of health professions education research. Based on the author’s own experiences, published guidelines, and discussions with international colleagues, the author found that research ethics can be roughly grouped into 3 distinct areas, each with its own distinct aims: protecting the integrity of science, protecting the integrity of research subjects, and protecting the integrity of authorship. The focus of this commentary is to provide some guiding thoughts on each of the 3 areas for mentors of emerging health professions education scholars.             While any framing logic is arbitrary, the 3 areas of research ethics can be illustrated by 9 distinct breaches of ethical principles, ranging from outright fraud to strategic authorship practices, and 27 practical lessons for learners to counter these and shape ethical research conduct. In general, the international variations in habits, rules, and regulations do not strike the author as being substantially different, but there are cultural variations in terms of what is emphasized and regulated.             The ethics of research in health professions education has developed quite extensively in the past few decades, following advances in biomedical and other research domains, and are now grounded in several useful and authoritative guidelines. At the end of the day, however, ethical research conduct is a matter of internalized rules and regulations that researchers must develop over time. Emerging scholars need both instruction and role models to develop their own moral compass to navigate the rules, regulations, and purposes of research ethics.},

  abstract = {Despite explanations in the literature, a returning question in the use of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) is how to distinguish them from competencies and skills. In this article, we attempt to analyze the causes of the frequent confusion and conflation of EPAs with competencies and skills, and argue why the distinction is important for education, qualification and patient safety. ‘Tracheotomy’, ‘lumbar puncture’, ‘interprofessional collaboration’ for example are colloquially called ‘skills’, but its is a person’s ability to perform these activities that is the actual skill; the EPA is simply the activity itself. We identify two possible causes for the confusion. One is a tendency to frame all educational objectives as EPAs. Many objectives of medical training can be conceptualized as EPAs, if ‘the ability to do X’ is the corresponding competency; but that does not work for all. We offer ways to deal with objectives of training that are not usefully conceptualized as EPAs. A more fundamental cause relates to entrustment decisions. The permission to contribute to health care reflects entrustment. Entrustment decisions are the links or pivots between a person’s readiness for the task and the actual task execution. However, if entrustment decisions do not lead to increased autonomy in the practice of health care, but only serve to decide upon the advancement to a next stage of training, EPAs can become the tick boxes learners feel they need to collect to ‘pass’. Gradually, then, EPAs can loose their original meaning of units of practice for which one becomes qualified.},

Exploring the “engagement interface” as the site for student engagement (SE), we offer a conceptual contribution in engaging with the Kahu and Nelson (2018) model by bringing in a fuller understanding of SE grounded in the higher education context rather than being uncritically transplanted from a compulsory education context. This involves consideration of the multiple facets of SE as well as the dynamic, shifting and multilocal nature of the construct. The paper then proceeds to enhance the details of the model, grounding them in a finer-grained reading of the literature and relating educational constructs to the model’s proposed “mechanisms” in a conceptually substantiated way. This further extends Kahu and Nelson’s aim of illuminating the “black box” of SE. Our third contribution is to practice by proposing tactics: informed by the literature, we invite practitioners to consider ways in which they can increase the likelihood of facilitating engagement with, and by, students more constructively.},

  abstract = {Phenomenon: Compassion, and related constructs such as empathy, are core values in healthcare, with known benefits for both patients and staff. Yet research on the factors that affect compassion and compassion-related constructs remains scattered. This review systematizes and synthesizes studies investigating the predictors of compassion and related constructs among medical students, allowing for a better understanding of the factors that both positively and negatively contribute to the development of compassionate future physicians. Approach: A systematic review of 12 databases for studies from database inception up until April 2020 was conducted. Non–peer-reviewed literature and studies in which {$>$}50\% of the sample were non-medical students were excluded. Intervention studies were also out of the scope of this review. We assessed risk of bias and confidence in the findings using standardized tools. Data were categorized within the Transactional Model of Physician Compassion, a framework in which compassion is influenced by personal (student), environmental, patient/family, and clinical factors. Findings: Of 14,060 retrieved articles, 222 studies were included. Of these, 95\% studied student factors, but only 25\% studied environmental, 9\% studied patient, and 6\% studied clinical factors. Predictors of greater compassion included maturity; work and life experiences; personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness; skills such as perspective taking, reflection, and mindfulness; and positive role modeling. Conversely, negative attitudes/emotions, burnout, stress, detachment, operating in cultures prioritizing knowledge and efficiency over humanistic care, negative role models, time constraints, and heavy workloads predicted lower compassion. Patient-related factors included “difficult” and “noncompliant” patients or those perceived as responsible for their illness. Overall, 60\% of studies had a serious risk of bias, particularly confounding and participant selection biases. Insights: Medical student compassion is predicted by a wide range of factors relating to the student, their training environment, their patients, and the clinical situation. However, existing research has largely focused on student factors (e.g., sociodemographic and dispositional traits), many of which are not amenable to intervention. Skills such as perspective taking, reflection, and mindfulness are associated with higher compassion and may present opportunities for intervention. There is also strong evidence that environmental factors shape students’ compassion. Researchers and educators should continue to explore the impact of patient and clinical factors on students’ compassion. Studies remain at high risk of bias.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies have primarily implemented problem-based learning (PBL) or flipped classroom (FC) teaching models in different majors; however, research on the combined PBL-FC teaching method in clinical medicine is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the combined PBL-FC teaching method in teaching ocular trauma on students’ competencies. Method: About 75 ophthalmology postgraduates were randomly divided into PBL-FC and traditional teaching groups. Students completed pre-and post-class theoretical examinations, skills evaluation, learning ability scales, and feedback questionnaires. Results: Both groups showed significantly higher theoretical scores and improved learning ability. Feedback questionnaire scores of the PBL-FC group’s postgraduates without clinical experience were significantly higher than the traditional group’s for some items; there was no difference between groups in postgraduates with clinical experience. PBL-FC group’s pre-class preparation time was significantly longer than the traditional group’s, but the post-class review time was significantly shorter. PBL-FC group’s post-class theoretical performance was significantly higher than the traditional group’s. There was no statistical difference between the groups regarding skill operation. Among postgraduates without clinical experience, the PBL-FC group’s skill operation performance was significantly higher than the traditional group’s; for postgraduates with clinical experience, the traditional group’s skill operation performance was significantly higher than the PBL-FC group’s. Conclusions: PBL-FC teaching is better for students without clinical experience or knowledge of ophthalmic diseases. Meanwhile, traditional teaching is a good choice for students with clinical experience who need more relevant knowledge.},

  abstract = {The growth and uptake of educational technology has significantly reshaped the delivery of distance and online learning. With an unprecedented number of learners engaging with online modes of education, there is a growing need to understand the underlying student enrolment motivations, goals and learning behaviours evolving from a highly diverse student population. Research in learning analytics has advanced the use of digital data to un­ derstand student learning processes. However, there remains a limited understanding of how non-traditional learner characteristics, needs and motivational factors influence their learning behaviour and engagement strategies. Survey data from 232 students enrolled in fully online degree programs at a large public research university in Australia has been examined and used to represent 1687 students that have not completed the survey. To characterise the larger population of students, we combined their demographics, digital trace data, and course performance to provide richer insights of non-traditional learners in online learning. Data science approaches are applied, including an unsupervised machine learning technique that revealed the results of six unique learner profiles, clearly differentiated by their motivation, demographic, engagement and performance. While the findings show that each learner profile faces unique study challenges, there are also unique oppor­ tunities associated with each profile that could be utilised to improve their learning outcomes. The practical implications of the study on teaching practices are further discussed.},

  abstract = {An affordance is what someone can do with an object. When you see a well-designed everyday product, the perceived affordances should indicate how to use it. You shouldn't have to struggle to figure out how to use your shower to take a shower, and you shouldn't have to use trial and error—perhaps drenching yourself in cold water in the process. The design of an everyday thing should make it evident. An object should communicate a good part of how to use it through its affordances. A recessed button affords pressing it. A sticking-out dial affords twiddling it. A toggle switch affords toggling. An apple affords tossing and catching it; an anvil doesn't. A high stool affords sitting, leaning against or standing on it. Don Norman, who popularised the term in his classic book~The Design of Everyday Things, talked a fair bit about doors. We can push or pull a door or slide it to the side. Sometimes, doors open upwards (though rarely downwards). In something as fundamental to our everyday living as a door, you might think that we had nailed their design sufficiently not to misuse them. However, I'm willing to bet that, like me, you have pulled a door when you needed to push it. A common culprit is adding a bar handle to a door on the side you need to push. While a flat plate attached to the door affords only pushing, a bar handle begs you to pull it. Often, a door designed this way gets a sign saying "Push." As Don Norman says, if your design needs a label, consider another design.~ Once, I nearly walked away from a library with my two small boys because of door confusion. After going through an outer set of glass doors that slid open automatically as we approached them, the next set of glass doors stood resolutely shut. Concluding that the library must be closed, we were just walking out when someone walked up to the second set of glass doors and simply pushed them open. The first set of automatic doors had so cued me that the second set would also be automatic, and the glass doors held no clue that they would operate differently from the outer set that I almost failed to get into an open building. Don Norman became so well known for pointing out the flaws of everyday objects that poorly designed products became known as "Norman doors." Don Norman's frustrations are mostly for everyday things. If you are an air traffic controller or an astronaut flying a space shuttle, it's reasonable to expect that some training may be wise to use all the advanced functionality. Yet in specialised environments like healthcare, good design—like avoiding storing drugs in alphabetical order—is critical to reduce the potential for failure. Digital products struggle to provide affordances. Apple's touchscreen interactions and trackpads have little discoverability of what you can do with them: swipe down from the top-right, swipe up from the bottom, double-tap the side button, long-press on an icon, two-finger swipe right, triple-finger tap—all effectively invisible. Interactions like these reward repeated use and require learning to be effective. However, I think it's reasonable to expect a warm shower in a hotel on your first try without requiring training.

Materials and methods: Performance data from 1182 consenting third year medical students in 9 cohorts (2011–2019), on a 17-item Clinical Communication Skills Assessment Tool (CCSAT) completed by trained Standardized Patients as part of an eight case high stakes Comprehensive Clinical Skills Exam (CCSE) were analyzed using latent profile analysis (LPA). Assessment domains included: information gathering (6 items), relationship development (5 items), patient education (3 items), and organization/time management (3 items). LPA clustered learners with similar strength/weakness into profiles based on item response patterns across cases. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed for significant differences by profile for CCSAT items. Results: Student performance clustered into six profiles in three groups, high performing (HP1 and HP2-Low Patient Education, 15.7\%), average performing (AP1 and AP2-Interrupters, 40.9\%), and lower performing profiles (LP1-Non-interrupters and LP2, 43.4\%) with adequate model fit estimations and similar distribution in each cohort. We identified 3 CCSAT items that discriminated among learner’s skill profiles. Conclusion: Clinical communication skill performance profiles provide nuanced, benchmarked guidance for curriculum improvement and tailoring of communication skills coaching.},

  abstract = {Background Since 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has surveyed residents and fellows in its accredited programs. The Resident/Fellow Survey is a screening and compliance tool that programs can also use for continuous quality improvement. However, stakeholders have reported potential problems with the survey’s overall quality and credibility. Objective To redesign the 2006 Resident/Fellow Survey using expert reviews and cognitive interviews. Methods In 2018-2019, the ACGME redesigned the Resident/Fellow Survey using an iterative validation process: expert reviews (evidence based on content) and cognitive interviews (evidence based on response processes). Expert reviews were conducted by a survey design firm and an ACGME Task Force; cognitive interviews were conducted with a diverse set of 27 residents and fellows. Results Expert reviews resulted in 21 new survey items to address the ACGME’s updated accreditation requirements; these reviews also led to improvements that align the survey items with evidence-informed standards. After these changes were made, cognitive interviews resulted in additional revisions to sensitive items, item order, and response option order, labels, and conceptual spacing. In all, cognitive interviews led to 11 item deletions and other improvements designed to reduce response error. Conclusions Expert reviews and cognitive interviews were used to redesign the Resident/Fellow Survey. The content of the redesigned survey aligns with the updated accreditation requirements and items are written in accordance with evidenceinformed standards. Additionally, cognitive interviews resulted in revisions to the survey that seem to improve respondents’ comprehension and willingness to respond to individual survey items.},

The goal was revised in 2019 to ‘measles and rubella elimination by 2023’ The strategies adopted to reach the goal included achieving ≥95\% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MCV2; RCV2); establishing effective case-based surveillance supported by an accredited laboratory network; and implementing rapid response measures to control measles outbreaks. Of the 11 countries in the Region, to date five countries have eliminated measles and rubella and two more have controlled rubella. An estimated 242 million cases and 4.7 million deaths due to measles were averted between 2014 and 2022. The high-level political commitment, programmatic infrastructure and partnerships developed for the elimination of polio and maternal and neonatal tetanus played a critical role in this achievement. WHO, supported by key partners, provided technical support and strategic guidance for programmatic improvements, generated evidence to guide policy and strategic shifts, strengthened capacity of health workforce and conducted periodic programmatic reviews. However, unexpected occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic impacted vaccine coverage and quality of surveillance, thereby delaying achievement of the goal, and necessitating a revision of the target date of elimination.},

Few empirical studies have explored professional identity formation (PIF) in residency, and little is known about supervisors’ perceptions of their roles in residents’ PIF. In this study, we sought to understand how supervisors perceive their roles in the PIF of General Practice (GP) residents. Materials and methods: Guided by principles of qualitative description, we conducted eight focus groups with 55 supervisors at four General Practice training institutes across the Netherlands. Informed by a conceptual framework of PIF, we performed a thematic analysis of focus group transcripts. Results: Three themes related to how GP supervisors described their roles in supporting residents’ PIF: supervising with the desired goal of GP training in mind; role modeling and mentoring as key strategies to achieve that goal; and the value of developing bonds of trust to support the process. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore PIF in GP training from the perspective of clinical supervisors. The identified themes mirror the components of the therapeutic alliance between doctors and patients from a supervisor’s perspective and highlight the pivotal roles of the supervisor in a resident’s PIF.},

This study investigates student profiles in a flipped classroom. The learning management system interactions of 375 medical students are collected and preprocessed.

Across all eight principles, we updated the research previously discussed while integrating new areas of research. Wherever possible, we applied a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens, exploring issues of power, identity, and belonging as they relate to teaching and learning.

In this study, the authors used hermeneutic phenomenology to ask: How do premedical students experience shame as they apply to medical school?                                         Method               From September 2020 to March 2021, the authors recruited 12 students from a U.S. Master of Biomedical Sciences program who intended to apply to medical school. Data collection consisted of each participant creating a “rich picture” depicting a shame experience during their premedical training, a semistructured interview that deeply explored this and other shame experiences, and a debriefing session. Data were analyzed using Ajjawi and Higgs’s 6 steps of hermeneutic analysis.                                         Results               Self-concept, composed of an individual’s identities and contingencies of self-esteem, was central to participants’ shame experiences. Through a confluence of past and future self-concepts and under the influence of external factors and the weight of expectations, shame often destabilized participants’ present self-concepts. This destabilization occurred because of events related to application processes (repeat Medical College Admission Test attempts), interpersonal interactions (prehealth advisor meetings), and objective performance measures (grades, test scores). Participants’ efforts to restabilize their self-concept catalyzed specific identity processes and self-concept formation.                                         Conclusions               Shame provided a window into the emotional experiences, identity processes, and ideologies that shape students’ attempts to enter medical school. The authors discuss the central role of contingencies of self-esteem, the potential origins of performance-based self-esteem in trainees, and the identity negotiation and identity work involved in shame reactions. They call for the adoption of contingencies of self-esteem within current conceptualizations of professional identity formation; training for faculty and prehealth advisors about the nature of shame in premedical learners; and consideration of the consequential validity of standardized tests, which may trigger damaging shame.},

  abstract = {Principles derived from the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML; Mayer in: Multimedia learning, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2021) provide valuable guidance for enlisting commonly-available technologies to create effective online multimedia lessons. Specifically, CTML can guide instructional designers on the use of slide-sharing programs to create concise, narrated animation segments; the use of survey programs to interpolate questions and prompts between these segments to facilitate generative learning activities; and the use of video-sharing sites to provide learners with control over relatively superficial aspects of instruction. The application of CTML to the design of online multimedia lessons raises a number of theoretical and practical questions, including the need to better understand the relationship between working memory capacity and working memory duration, the importance of retrieval as a learning process, and the relative impact of selection and organization processes on learning.},

  abstract = {This systematic review aims to explore how student partnership is enacted in higher education assessment using community of practice and liminality of student roles as the conceptual framework. Forty-three empirical studies were selected, and extracted data were synthesised using thematic analysis. The results show that student partnership occurs in four main areas of assessment – assessment and feedback design, execution and implementation, quality assurance, policy establishment – and that students adopt the role of co-designers, assessors, consultants and decision-makers in assessment partnerships. The analysis also reveals four types of support university staff can provide to facilitate partnerships: essential knowledge, training and coaching, accuracy and quality check and partnership management. Based on the findings, a framework is proposed to elucidate student partnership in assessment as situated learning in a community of practice. The findings of this review have theoretical and practical implications for policy makers, researchers and practitioners.},

Despite the large differences between the two phases, few studies have explored their separate effects on flipped learning. This study conducted a hierarchical linear regression to investigate how the two sequential phases and their featured behaviors can predict learning performance and experience in a flipped classroom at the undergraduate level. The results indicated that students' pre-class discussion positively predicted their assignment scores to a moderate degree, while the in-class collaboration was negatively correlated with test scores. However, the two phases had a limited impact on students' flipped learning experience. The results also highlight the influence of students' initial interest and prior achievement on their flipped learning experience. The findings can extend our understanding of the flipped classroom approach and inform its design and implementation in higher education contexts.},

  abstract = {Background: Most medical students entering clerkships have limited understanding of clinical reasoning concepts. The value of teaching theories of clinical reasoning and cognitive biases to first-year medical students is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the value of explicitly teaching clinical reasoning theory and cognitive bias to first-year medical students. Methods: Using Kolb’s experiential learning model, we introduced dual process theory, script theory, and cognitive biases in teaching clinical reasoning to first-year medical students at an academic medical center in New York City between January and June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instruction was transitioned to a distance learning format in March 2020. The curriculum included a series of written clinical reasoning examinations with facilitated small group discussions. Written self-assessments prompted each student to reflect on the experience, draw conclusions about their clinical reasoning, and plan for future encounters involving clinical reasoning. We evaluated the value of the curriculum using mixed-methods to analyze faculty assessments, student self-assessment questionnaires, and an end-ofcurriculum anonymous questionnaire eliciting student feedback. Results: Among 318 total examinations of 106 students, 254 (80\%) had a complete problem representation, while 199 (63\%) of problem representations were considered concise. The most common cognitive biases described by students in their clinical reasoning were anchor­ ing bias, availability bias, and premature closure. Four major themes emerged as valuable outcomes of the CREs as identified by students: (1) synthesis of medical knowledge; (2) enhanced ability to generate differential diagnoses; (3) development of self-efficacy related to clinical reasoning; (4) raised awareness of personal cognitive biases. Conclusions: We found that explicitly teaching clinical reasoning theory and cognitive biases using an experiential learning model provides first-year medical students with valuable opportunities for developing knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy related to clinical reasoning.

  abstract = {Selection is the first assessment of medical education and training. Medical schools must select from a pool of academically successful applicants and ensure that the way in which they choose future clinicians is robust, defensible, fair to all who apply and cost-effective. However, there is no comprehensive and evidence-informed guide to help those tasked with setting up or rejuvenating their local selection process. To address this gap, our guide draws on the latest research, international case studies and consideration of common dilemmas to provide practical guidance for designing, implementing and evaluating an effective medical school selection system. We draw on a model from the field of instructional design to frame the many different activities involved in doing so: the ADDIE model. ADDIE provides a systematic framework of Analysis (of the outcomes to be achieved by the selection process, and the barriers and facilitators to achieving these), Design (what tools and content are needed so the goals of selection are achieved), Development (what materials and resources are needed and available), Implementation (plan [including piloting], do study and adjust) and Evaluation (quality assurance is embedded throughout but the last step involves extensive evaluation of the entire process and its outcomes).HIGHLIGHTSRobust, defensible and fair selection into medical school is essential. This guide systematically covers the processes required to achieve this, from needs analysis through design, development and implementation, to evaluation of the success of a selection process.},

In teaching contexts, the ability to provide feedback to learners is central to their role. Suboptimal feedback practices may deny learners the valuable feedback they need to learn and improve. This scoping review systematically maps the evidence related to SPs' role as educators and identifies how SPs prepare for their role and feedback practices. METHODS: The authors conducted a scoping review and included a group of international stakeholders with experience and expertise in SP methodology. Five online databases were systematically searched and ERIC, MedEdPortal and MedEdPublish were hand searched to identify relevant studies. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were developed. Data screening and subsequently data charting were performed in pairs. The results of data charting were thematically analysed including categories relating to the Association of SP Educators (ASPE) Standards of Best Practice (SOBP). RESULTS: From 8179 articles identified for the title and abstract screening, 98 studies were included. Studies reported the benefit of SPs' authentic role portrayal and feedback interactions for learners and on the reported learning outcomes. Data was heterogeneous with a notable lack of consistency in the detail regarding the scenario formats for communication skills training interventions, SP characteristics, and approaches to training for feedback and role portrayal. CONCLUSIONS: The published literature has considerable heterogeneity in reporting how SPs are prepared for role portrayal and feedback interactions. Additionally, our work has identified gaps in the implementation of the ASPE SOBP, which promotes effective SP-learner feedback interactions. Further research is required to identify effective applications of SP methodology to prepare SPs for their role as educators.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Preclinical medical education is content-dense and time-constrained. Flipped classroom approaches promote durable learning, but challenges with unsatisfactory student preparation and high workload remain. Cognitive load theory defines instructional design as “efficient” if learners can master the presented concepts without cognitive overload. We created a PReparatory Evaluation Process (PREP) to systematically assess and measure improvement in the cognitive-load efficiency of preparatory materials and impact on study time (time-efficiency). Methods\enspace{} We conducted this study in a flipped, multidisciplinary course for \textasciitilde\,170 first year students at Harvard Medical School using a naturalistic post-test design. For each flipped session (n\,=\,97), we assessed cognitive load and preparatory study time by administering a 3-item PREP survey embedded within a short subject-matter quiz students completed before class. Over three years (2017–2019), we evaluated cognitive load- and time- based efficiency to guide iterative revisions of the materials by content experts. The ability of PREP to detect changes to the instructional design (sensitivity) was validated through a manual audit of the materials. Results\enspace{} The average survey response rate was ≥ 94\%. Content expertise was not required to interpret PREP data. Initially students did not necessarily allocate the most study time to the most difficult content. Over time, the iterative changes in instructional design increased the cognitive load- and time-based efficiency of preparatory materials with large effect sizes (p\,{$<$}\,.01). Furthermore, this increased the overall alignment of cognitive load with study time: students allocated more time to difficult content away from more familiar, less difficult content without increasing workload overall. Conclusions\enspace{} Cognitive load and time constraints are important parameters to consider when designing curricula. The PREP process is learner-centered, grounded in educational theory, and works independently of content knowledge. It can provide rich and actionable insights into instructional design of flipped classes not captured by traditional satisfaction-based evaluations.},

  abstract = {Clinical history taking and physical examination are two of the most important competencies of physicians. In addition to informing diagnoses, these activities build rapport and establish relationships between caregivers and patients. Despite this, emphasis on the assessment of bedside clinical skills is declining. To prepare our students for clinical work, we began a clinical competency, personalised teaching programme in which students perform a history and physical examination in front of a master clinical teacher (MCT) approximately every 2 weeks throughout their core clerkship year. The MCT works with the student in a clinical encounter, providing personalised bedside instruction on all features of being a clinician including bedside manner, history-taking skills, physical examination skills, and clinical reasoning. The MCT then provides an assessment of student’s competency development and gives feedback to the student about what they do well and where they have opportunities for growth. Assessment data are collected and tracked longitudinally across the clerkship phase to ensure that each student is progressing developmentally. With over 6000 observations of student performance, we are able to discern competency development and growth over time. We can identify if a student is not improving as expected during their clerkship phase and intervene by providing extra practice and training. This core clerkship teaching programme has been well received by both students and instructors and has led us to pilot this approach during the post-clerkship phase of our medical training.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision-making (CDM) is the ability to make clinical choices based on the knowledge and information available to the physician. It often refers to individual cognitive processes that becomes more dependent with the acquisition of experience and knowledge. Previous research has used dual-process theory to explain the cognitive processes involved in how physicians acquire experiences that help them develop CDM. However, less is known about how CDM is shaped by the physicians’ situated cognition in the clinical environment. This is especially challenging for novice physicians, as they need to be adaptive to compensate for the lack of experience. The adaptive expert framework has been used to explain how novice physicians learn, but it has not yet been explored, how adaptive expertise is linked to clinical decision-making amongst novice physicians. This study aimed to analyse how residents utilize and develop adaptive expert cognition in a natural setting. By describing cognitive processes through verbalization of thought processes, we sought to explore their CDM strategies considering the adaptive expert framework. We used concurrent and retrospective think-aloud interviews in a natural setting of an emergency department (ED) at a university hospital, to query residents about their reasoning during a patient encounter. We analysed data using protocol analysis to map cognitive strategies from these verbalizations. Subsequently in a narrative analysis, we compared these strategies with the literature on adaptive expertise. Fourteen interviews were audio recorded over the course for 17 h of observation. We coded 78 informational concepts and 46 cognitive processes. The narrative analysis demonstrated how epistemic distance was prevalent in the initial CDM process and self-regulating processes occurred during hypothesis testing. However, residents who too quickly moved on to hypothesis testing tended to have to redirect their hypothesis more often, and thus be more laborious in their CDM. Uncertainty affected physicians’ CDM when they did not reconcile their professional role with being allowed to be uncertain. This allowance is an important feature of orientation to new knowledge as it facilitates the evaluation of what the physician does not know. For the resident to learn to act as an adaptive decision-maker, she relied on contextual support. The professional role was crucial in decisional competency. This supports current literature, which argues that role clarification helps decisional competency. This study adds that promoting professional development by tolerating uncertainty may improve adaptive decisional competency.},

We celebrate gifted students in school, natural athletes in sports, and child prodigies in music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to overlook the distance we ourselves can travel. We underestimate the range of skills that we can learn and the amount of ground that we can gain. When opportunity doesn't knock, there are ways to build a door. Hidden Potential offers a new framework for reaching aspirations and exceeding expectations. Realizing potential isn't about being a workaholic or a perfectionist. What matters most is not how hard we work, but how well we learn. It's not about being a genius-growth depends more on developing character skills than cognitive skills. The character skills that propel progress include the proactivity to absorb and adapt to new information, the courage to embrace discomfort, and the determination to find the beauty in imperfections. Mastering those skills doesn't require us to find the one perfect mentor or expert coach to guide us. Often we just need to borrow a compass to begin charting our own path. And we can clear the path for more people by building better systems of opportunity in our schools, teams, and workplaces. Many writers have chronicled the habits of superstars who accomplish great things. This book breaks new ground by revealing how anyone can rise to achieve greater things. The true measure of your potential isn't the height of the peak you reach, but how far you climb to get there"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Student engagement is a complex multidimensional construct that has attained great interest in health professions education (HPE). Definition and conceptualization of student engagement is an important step that should drive the development of the instruments for its measurement. We have recently proposed a comprehensive framework for student engagement in HPE with a definition of engagement as student investment of time and energy in academic and non-academic experiences that include learning, teaching, research, governance, and community activities. The dimensions of student engagement in this framework included the cognitive, affective, behavioral, agentic, and socio-cultural. Guided by the student engagement framework, this non-systematic review aims to identify, critically appraise, and summarize the existing methods for measuring student engagement in HPE. Extrapolating from higher education literature, we attempted to link the theoretical perspectives of student engagement with the published methods of its measurement in HPE context. In addition, we have described the different methods of measuring stu‑dent engagement including self-report surveys, real time measures, direct observation, interviews/focus groups, and the use of multiple instruments. The span of engagement dimensions measured by self-report surveys ranges from one to five dimensions. However, measurement of agentic and sociocultural dimensions of engagement in HPE is still limited and further research is required. We have also reflected on the existing methods of measuring engagement of students as active partners in HPE. The review also describes the advantages, limitations, and psychometric proper‑ties of each method for measuring student engagement. We ended the review with a guiding conclusion on how to develop and select an instrument for measuring student engagement in HPE. Finally, we addressed the gaps in the literature about measuring engagement of HPE students and future research plans.},

A deeper understanding of this phenomenon may avert the vicious cycle of academic failure. Hence, this study investigated the process of academic failure among medical students in Year 1. Methods\enspace{} This study employed a document phenomenological approach, which is a systematic process to examine documents, interpret them to attain understanding, and develop empirical knowledge of the phenomenon studied. Using document analysis, interview transcripts and reflective essays of 16 Year 1 medical students who experienced academic failure were analysed. Based on this analysis, codes were developed and further reduced into categories and themes. Thirty categories in eight themes were linked to make sense of the series of events leading to academic failure. Results\enspace{} One or more critical incidents commenced during the academic year, which led to possible resulting events. The students had poor attitudes, ineffective learning methods, health problems or stress. Students progressed to mid-year assessments and reacted differently to their results in the assessments. Afterwards, the students tried different types of attempts, and they still failed the end-of-year assessments. The general process of academic failure is illustrated in a diagram describing chronological events. Conclusion\enspace{} Academic failure may be explained by a series of events (and consequences) of what students experience and do and how they respond to their experiences. Preventing a preceding event may prevent students from suffering these consequences.},

  abstract = {This paper is part of a series of methodological guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Rapid reviews (RR) use modified systematic review methods to accelerate the review process while maintaining systematic, transparent and reproducible methods. In this paper, we address considerations for RR searches. We cover the main areas relevant to the search process: preparation and planning, information sources and search methods, search strategy development, quality assurance, reporting, and record management. Two options exist for abbreviating the search process: (1) reducing time spent on conducting searches and (2) reducing the size of the search result. Because screening search results is usually more resource-­intensive than conducting the search, we suggest investing time upfront in planning and optimising the search to save time by reducing the literature screening workload. To achieve this goal, RR teams should work with an information specialist. They should select a small number of relevant information sources (eg, databases) and use search methods that are highly likely to identify relevant literature for their topic. Database search strategies should aim to optimise both precision and sensitivity, and quality assurance measures (peer review and validation of search strategies) should be applied to minimise errors.},

These data have considerable potential to bring digital technologies in education to a new level of personalized learning and data-driven management of the educational process. However, the way data are collected and stored in a typical university makes it difficult to achieve the mentioned goals, with limited examples of data being used for the purposes of learning analytics . In this work, based on the analysis of existing information systems and databases at Siberian Federal University, we propose principles of design for a university database architecture that allow for the development and implementation of a data-driven management approach. We consider various levels of detail of education data, describe the database organization and structure, and provide examples of learning analytics tools that can benefit from the proposed approach. Furthermore, we discuss various aspects of its implementation and associated questions.},

  abstract = {The research study explored online language learners’ self-directed language learning (SDLL) experiences, benefits, motivations, and challenges when employing educational tools like Duolingo in an out of classroom context. To gain insights into SDLL, in-depth and semi-structured interviews with 10 Duolingo users were conducted. Study results indicated that learners manage various human and material learning resources in complementary ways to accomplish their language learning goals. Importantly, Duolingo learners self-monitor their learning process through feelings of knowing, content evaluation, and judgments of the adequacy of information and resources available. In addition, the study found that Duolingo learners highly rely on the features of learning technology to track, monitor, and reinforce their learning. Additionally, learners in this study were mostly driven by intrinsic needs and interests, such as culture, travel, and brain training, rather than obtaining certificates, scores, or grades. While most existing studies on self-directed language learning (SDLL) with technology have been conducted in a formal learning context, the results of this study provide some insights into SDLL independent of formal school contexts.},

  abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate a unique approach to learning languages through self-directed online learning. Specifically, it explores the self-management abilities and skills learners need while learning a language outside traditional classroom settings when using mobile-assisted learning technology.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods approach was used in this study, including an online survey of 84 people and 10 semi-structured interviews.FindingsFindings reveal the significant role of specific and well-defined learning goals in enhancing learners' performance. These goals can be either self-initiated by the learners themselves or defined by the technological features of the learning platform. However, the presence of distractions in learners' daily lives presents challenges to effective time management, affecting learners both physically and psychologically. A key aspect of self-directed language learning lies in the learners' ability to seek out relevant human and material resources beyond the confines of a single mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) tool. The authenticity of these resources is crucial in ensuring meaningful and effective learning experiences.Research limitations/implicationsUnderstanding how learners navigate and discover valuable resources is a central focus of this study. This research offers valuable insights into the field of self-directed language learning, revealing the pivotal role of self-management skills with mobile-assisted learning technology. The findings contribute to the broader field of language education and offer practical implications for educators and developers seeking to optimize self-directed language learning experiences through innovative and technologically driven approaches.Originality/valueMALL is often ideal for individualized informal learning, but the existing literature focuses heavily on formal learning situations, underestimating the importance of MALL practices in various informal settings. Most research reports on MALL-based self-directed learning primarily sample traditional English-learning university students. Therefore, there is a need for research on how nontraditional older adult learners self-direct their language learning with mobile technology outside the classroom.},

  abstract = {Students’ beliefs about their abilities (called “lay theories”) affect their motivations, behaviors, and academic success. Lay theories include beliefs about the potential to improve intelligence (mindset), who (i.e., everyone or only some people) has the potential to be excellent in a field (universality), and whether reaching excellence in a field requires raw intellectual talent (brilliance). Research demonstrates that each of these beliefs influences students’ educational experiences and academic outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether they represent distinct latent constructs or are susceptible to the “jangle fallacy” (i.e., different names given to the same underlying construct). We conducted a multiphase, mixed-methods study to 1) evaluate whether mindset, universality, and brilliance beliefs represent conceptually and empirically discriminable concepts, and 2) evaluate whether mindset, universality, and brilliance beliefs contribute unique explanatory value for both psychosocial (e.g., sense of belonging) and academic outcomes (e.g., course grades). To address these questions, we developed and collected validity evidence for a new measure of science and math undergraduates’ lay theories, called the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) survey. Factor analyses suggest that mindset, brilliance, and universality are distinct and empirically discriminable constructs. Structural Equation Models indicate that each lay theory contributes unique predictive value to relevant outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Qualitative research explains observations, focusing on how and why phenomena and experiences occur. Qualitative methods go beyond quantitative data and provide critical information inaccessible through quantitative methods. However, at all levels of medical education, there is insufficient exposure to qualitative research. As a result, residents and fellows complete training ill-­equipped to appraise and conduct qualitative studies. As a first step to increasing education in qualitative methods, we sought to create a curated collection of papers for faculty to use in teaching qualitative research at the graduate medical education (GME) level. Methods: We conducted literature searches on the topic of teaching qualitative research to residents and fellows and queried virtual medical education and qualitative research communities for relevant articles. We searched the reference lists of all articles found through the literature searches and online queries for additional articles. We then conducted a three-r­ound modified Delphi process to select papers most relevant to faculty teaching qualitative research. Results: We found no articles describing qualitative research curricula at the GME level. We identified 74 articles on the topic of qualitative research methods. The modified Delphi process identified the top nine articles or article series most relevant for faculty teaching qualitative research. Several articles explain qualitative methods in the context of medical education, clinical care, or emergency care research. Two articles describe standards of high-­quality qualitative studies, and one article discusses how to conduct the individual qualitative interview to collect data for a qualitative study. Conclusions: While we identified no articles reporting already existing qualitative research curricula for residents and fellows, we were able to create a collection of papers on qualitative research relevant to faculty seeking to teach qualitative methods. These papers describe key qualitative research concepts important in instructing trainees as they appraise and begin to develop their own qualitative studies.},

  abstract = {Objective: Clerkship is crucial for fourth-year medical students before entering the clinical environment. However, lack of confidence impairs clerks’ performance during the clinical rotation. We assess the impact of formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) with immediate feedback on surgical clerks’ self-confidence and clinical competence. Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled study. Thirty-eight fourth-year medical students starting their surgical clerkship were randomly divided into the control group (n ¼ 19) and the OSCE group (n ¼ 19), where an extra 6-station formative OSCE was given prior to the surgical rotation with immediate feedback on the participant’s performance. Self-confidence assessment (SCA) was collected from each participant before, right after the formative OSCE and one month later. Clinical competence was assessed using a mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) with a case of acute abdominal pain and direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) with incision and suture one month later. Results: The SCAs were significantly improved in the OSCE group right after the training, and a month later, compared to the control group. The mini-CEX score was significantly higher in the OSCE group compared to the control group, but not the DOPS score of incision and suture. Conclusion: The formative OSCE with immediate feedback could significantly enhance surgical clerks’ self-confidence and their clinical competence when taking the history, performing the physical examination, and in clinical reasoning; however, the formative OSCE did not improve their dexterity in performing the procedural skills.},

  abstract = {Online learning in Health Professions Education (HPE) has been evolving over decades, but COVID-19 changed its use abruptly. Technology allowed necessary HPE during COVID-19, but also demonstrated that many HP educators and learners had little knowledge and experience of these complex sociotechnical environments. Due to the educational benefits and flexibility that technology can afford, many higher education experts agree that online learning will continue and evolve long after COVID-19. As HP educators stand at the crossroads of technology integration, it is important that we examine the evidence, theories, advantages/disadvantages, and pedagogically informed design of online learning. This Guide will provide foundational concepts and practical strategies to support HPE educators and institutions toward advancing pedagogically informed use of online HPE. This Guide consists of two parts. The first part will provide an overview of evidence, theories, formats, and educational design in online learning, including contemporary issues and considerations such as learner engagement, faculty development, inclusivity, accessibility, copyright, and privacy. The second part (to be published as a separate Guide) focuses on specific technology tool types with practical examples for implementation and integration of the concepts discussed in Guide 1, and will include digital scholarship, learning analytics, and emerging technologies. In sum, both guides should be read together, as Guide 1 provides the foundation required for the practical application of technology showcased in Guide 2.

  abstract = {Abstract             Mindset theory explains how learners’ beliefs about intelligence and learning affect how they perceive effort, react to failure, and respond to feedback in challenging learning contexts. Mindset theory distinguishes between growth mindset (the belief that human capacities can be developed over time) and fixed mindset (the belief that human capacities are inherent and unchangeable). Efforts to develop growth mindset in learners have shown a wide range of benefits, including positive effects on students’ resilience, commitment to lifelong learning, and persistence in a field of study, with notable impacts on learners who are struggling, learners from minoritized groups, and women in scientific fields. In recent years, mindset theory interventions have caught the interest of medical educators, who recognize that traditional medical education, with its emphasis on grades, standardized examination performance, and high perceived cost of failure, may actually reinforce fixed mindsets and thus erode resilience among learners. However, the increased popularity of mindset theory must be met with a more nuanced understanding of the theory, including increased awareness of the concept of “false growth mindset,” a term coined by Carol Dweck to refer to common pitfalls in the theory’s application. In this article, the authors highlight important findings from mindset interventions in medical education, identify common pitfalls of false growth mindset in the context of medical learners, and offer suggestions for how educators and institutions can better instigate changes to promote growth mindsets within medical education.},

In this AMEE Guide, we define reflexivity as a set of continuous, collaborative, and multifaceted practices through which researchers self-consciously critique, appraise, and evaluate how their subjectivity and context influence the research processes. We frame reflexivity as a way to embrace and value researchers’ subjectivity. We also describe the purposes that reflexivity can have depending on different paradigmatic choices. We then address how researchers can account for the significance of the intertwined personal, interpersonal, methodological, and contextual factors that bring research into being and offer specific strategies for communicating reflexivity in research dissemination. With the growth of qualitative research in health professions education, it is essential that qualitative researchers carefully consider their paradigmatic stance and use reflexive practices to align their decisions at all stages of their research. We hope this Guide will illuminate such a path, demonstrating how reflexivity can be used to develop and communicate rigorous qualitative research.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews are vital instruments for researchers to understand broad trends in a field and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of interventions in addressing specific issues. The quality of a systematic review depends critically on having comprehensively surveyed all relevant literature on the review topic. In addition to database searching, handsearching is an important supplementary technique that helps increase the likelihood of identifying all relevant studies in a literature search. Traditional handsearching requires reviewers to manually browse through a curated list of field-specific journals and conference proceedings to find articles relevant to the review topic. This manual process is not only time-consuming, laborious, costly, and error-prone due to human fatigue, but it also lacks replicability due to its cumbersome manual nature. To address these issues, this paper presents a free and open-source Python package and an accompanying web-app, Paperfetcher, to automate the retrieval of article metadata for handsearching. With Paperfetcher's assistance, researchers can retrieve article metadata from designated journals within a specified time frame in just a few clicks. In addition to handsearching, it also incorporates a beta version of citation searching in both forward and backward directions. Paperfetcher has an easy-to-use interface, which allows researchers to download the metadata of retrieved studies as a list of DOIs or as an RIS file to facilitate seamless import into systematic review screening software. To the best of our knowledge, Paperfetcher is the first tool to automate handsearching with high usability and a multi-disciplinary focus.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The developmental trajectory of learning during residency may be attributed to multiple factors, including variation in individual trainee performance, program-level factors, graduating medical school effects, and the learning environment. Understanding the relationship between medical school and learner performance during residency is important in prioritizing undergraduate curricular strategies and educational approaches for effective transition to residency and postgraduate training. This study explores factors contributing to longitudinal and developmental variability in resident Milestones ratings, focusing on variability due to graduating medical school, training program, and learners using national cohort data from emergency medicine (EM) and family medicine (FM).                                         Method               Data from programs with residents entering training in July 2016 were used (EM: n=1,645 residents, 178 residency programs; FM: n=3,997 residents, 487 residency programs). Descriptive statistics were used to examine data trends. Cross-classified mixed-effects regression were used to decompose variance components in Milestones ratings.                                         Results               During postgraduate year (PGY)-1, graduating medical school accounted for 5\% and 6\% of the variability in Milestones ratings, decreasing to 2\% and 5\% by PGY-3 for EM and FM, respectively. Residency program accounted for substantial variability during PGY-1 (EM=70\%, FM=53\%) but decreased during PGY-3 (EM=62\%, FM=44\%), with greater variability across training period in patient care (PC), medical knowledge (MK), and systems-based practice (SBP). Learner variance increased significantly between PGY-1 (EM=23\%, FM=34\%) and PGY-3 (EM=34\%, FM=44\%), with greater variability in practice-based learning and improvement (PBLI), professionalism (PROF), and interpersonal communication skills (ICS).                                         Conclusions               The greatest variance in Milestone ratings can be attributed to the residency program and to a lesser degree, learners, and medical school. The dynamic impact of program-level factors on learners shifts during the first year and across the duration of residency training, highlighting the influence of curricular, instructional, and programmatic factors on resident performance throughout residency.},

While this piece acknowledges the groundbreaking changes currently wrought by generative AI technologies in HE, its focus on overarching principles and frameworks rather than with capturing the current rapidly-changing state of the tech industry. The chapter asks: does AI bring to HE the promised/assumed benefits to student support and learning or is it yet another symptom of HE’s massification, further complicated by justice and equity issues? Drawing on data justice and ethics of care scholarship, the chapter seeks to answer: (a) how can AI be used in HE for good, (b) how can this rapidly growing industry be regulated, and (c) what would a conceptual framework for data justice and fair usage of AI in HE look like?},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescents face unprecedented mental health challenges, and technology has the opportunity to facilitate access and support digitally connected generations. The combination of digital tools and live human connection may hold particular promise for resonating with and flexibly supporting young people's mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the BeMe app-based platform to support adolescents' mental health and well-being and to examine app engagement, usability, and satisfaction. METHODS: Adolescents in the United States, aged 13 to 20 years, were recruited via the web and enrolled between September 1 and October 31, 2022. App engagement, feature use, clinical functioning, and satisfaction with BeMe were examined for 30 days. BeMe provides content based on cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, motivational interviewing, and positive psychology; interactive activities; live text-based coaching; links to clinical services; and crisis support tools (digital and live). RESULTS: The average age of the sample (N=13,421) was 15.04 (SD 1.7) years, and 56.72\% (7612/13,421) identified with she/her pronouns. For the subsample that completed the in-app assessments, the mean scores indicated concern for depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire mean 15.68/20, SD 5.9; n=239), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire mean 13.37/17, SD 5.0; n=791), and poor well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-being Index mean 30.15/100, SD 16.1; n=1923). Overall, the adolescents engaged with BeMe for an average of 2.38 (SD 2.7) days in 7.94 (SD 24.1) sessions and completed 11.26 (SD 19.8) activities. Most adolescents engaged with BeMe's content (12,270/13,421, 91.42\%), mood ratings (13,094/13,421, 97.56\%), and interactive skills (10,098/13,421, 75.24\%), and almost one-fifth of the adolescents engaged with coaching (2539/13,421, 18.92\%), clinical resources (2411/13,421, 17.96\%), and crisis support resources (2499/13,421, 18.62\%). Overall app engagement (total activities) was highest among female and gender-neutral adolescents compared with male adolescents (all P{$<$}.001) and was highest among younger adolescents (aged 13-14 years) compared with all other ages (all P{$<$}.001). Satisfaction ratings were generally high for content (eg, 158/176, 89.8\% rated as helpful and 1044/1139, 91.66\% improved coping self-efficacy), activities (5362/8468, 63.32\% helpful and 4408/6072, 72.6\% useful in coping with big feelings), and coaching (747/894, 83.6\% helpful and 747/894, 83.6\% improved coping self-efficacy). Engagement (total activities completed) predicted the likelihood of app satisfaction (P{$<$}.001). CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents downloaded the BeMe app and completed multiple sessions and activities. Engagement with BeMe was higher among female and younger adolescents. Ratings of BeMe's content, activities, and coaching were very positive for cognitive precursors aimed at reducing depression and anxiety and improving well-being. The findings will inform future app development to promote more sustained engagement, and future evaluations will assess the effects of BeMe on changes in mental health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The information systems designed to support clinical care have evolved separately from those that support health professions education. This has resulted in a considerable digital divide between patient care and education, one that poorly serves practitioners and organizations, even as learning becomes ever more important to both. In this perspective, we advocate for the enhancement of existing health information systems so that they intentionally facilitate learning. We describe three well-regarded frameworks for learning that can point toward how health care information systems can best evolve to support learning. The Master Adaptive Learner model suggests ways that the individual practitioner can best organize their activities to ensure continual self-improvement. The PDSA cycle similarly proposes actions for improvement but at a health care organization's workflow level. Senge's Five Disciplines of the Learning Organization, a more general framework from the business literature, serves to further inform how disparate information and knowledge flows can be managed for continual improvement. Our main thesis holds that these types of learning frameworks should inform the design and integration of information systems serving the health professions. An underutilized mediator of educational improvement is the ubiquitous electronic health record. The authors list learning analytic opportunities, including potential modifications of learning management systems and the electronic health record, that would enhance health professions education and support the shared goal of delivering high-quality evidence-based health care.},

Traditional definitions are challenged, distinctions are made between roles such as mentor, advisor, coach and sponsor. As educational environments change and options for professional development expand, we argue that the traditional dyadic format of mentoring alone will not help mentees to maximise their professional growth. Newer formats of mentoring are discussed in detail and their advantages and disadvantages compared. We use a variety of theoretical concepts to anchor the practice of mentorship: self-focussed and other-focussed motives; psychological safety; personal interpretive framework; Daloz model for balancing support and challenge; zone of proximal development; communities of practice; and development along multiple layers of competence. Recommended strategies for effective mentoring are based on extensive review of literature, as well as combined professional mentoring experiences of the authors. We use key principles from the theories described and phases of mentoring relationships as foundations for the suggested best practices of mentorship. Finally, we emphasise the role of mentees in their own professional development and provide tips for them on seeking mentors, expanding their mentoring network and taking the lead in setting the agenda during mentoring meetings and formulating action plans for their own advancement.},

  abstract = {Reviews of the literature on leadership training in undergraduate medical education have been conducted since 2014. Previous reviews have not identified networks, defined leadership, studied the selection criteria for instructors, nor analyzed leadership as interprofessional or transprofessional education. This scoping review fills these gaps. Inclusion criteria included use of competency-based education to teach leadership in universities, and quality assessment. Indexes and grey literature in Spanish, Portuguese, and English languages were included from six databases. Hand searching and consultation were employed for selected bodies of literature. This review identified leadership interventions in nine countries which had national and international networks primarily in English-speaking and European countries. No literature was found in Spanish-speaking or Portuguese-speaking countries, nor in Africa. Teaching leadership was linked mainly with undergraduate medical education and interprofessional education. This review identified 23 leadership and leader definitions and underscored the importance of including values in leadership definitions. Instructors were selected by discipline, role, experience, and expertise. This review may be used to inform the teaching of leadership in undergraduate medical curricula by suggesting potential networks, reflecting on diverse leadership definitions and interprofessional/transprofessional education, and assisting in selection of instructors.},

  abstract = {Introduction In an age of increasingly face-to-face, blended, and online Health Professions Education, students have more choices of institutions at which to study their degree. For an applicant, oftentimes, the first step is to learn more about a program through its website. Websites allow programs to convey their unique voice and to share their mission and values with others such as applicants, researchers, and academics. Additionally, as the number of master in health professions education (MHPE), or equivalent, programs rapidly grows, websites can share the priorities of these programs. Methods In this study, we conducted a website review of 158 MHPE websites to explore their geographical distributions, missions, educational concentrations, and various programmatic components. Results We compiled this information and synthesized pertinent aspects, such as program similarities and differences, or highlighted the omission of critical data. Conclusions Given that websites are often the first point of contact for prospective applicants, curious collaborators, and potential faculty, the digital image of MHPE programs matters. We believe our findings demonstrate opportunities for growth within institutions and assist the field in identifying the priorities of MHPE programs. As programs begin to shape their websites with more intentionality, they can reflect their relative divergence/convergence compared to other programs as they see fit and, therefore, attract individuals to best match this identity. Periodic reviews of the breadth of programs, such as those undergone here, are necessary to capture diversifying goals, and serves to help advance the field of MHPE as a whole.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Different variables have been used to predict the academic performance of students in medical schools. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of demographics, admission system, and high-school background on the academic performance of medical students. Methods\enspace{} We conducted this longitudinal cohort study on 808 students admitted to the Faculty of. Medicine at the University of Jordan (Amman, Jordan), in the years 2012 and 2013. Admission pathway, and academic performance data were collected and analyzed. Results\enspace{} A total of 808 students [i.e., 426 (52.7\%) females, and 382(47.3\%) males] were identified. Admitted students were holding 17 different types of high school degrees, and were accepted through 6 different quota pathways (open competition [National unified admission], underprivileged [“Makrumah”], parallel, children of university staff, international students, and others). Students admitted through the open competition and the underprivileged quota(Makrumah) were more likely to graduate on time and had higher graduation grades while students admitted through the parallel, international and others quota were more likely to fail and had lower graduation grades. Regarding highs school degrees, the students that were more likely to graduate were those with IB and the Jordanian high school degrees. The highest graduation GPA was for IB students followed by SAT, IGCSE as well as Jordanian and Syrian high school degrees respectively. IB, Jordanian, Kuwaiti and IGSC high school grades were significantly correlated with the graduation GPA. Conclusions\enspace{} Admission criteria such as type of high school degree and grades as well as admission pathways can predict the likelihood to graduate and the graduation GPA of medical students. Open competition and underprivileged admission pathways as well as IB, IGCSE and Jordanian high school degrees seem to be better predictors of student performance in the medical school.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this systematic review was to examine self-directed learning (SDL) assessment practices in undergraduate health professions education. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to retrieve English-language articles published between 2015 and July of 2022, investigating assessment of SDL learning outcomes. Extracted data included the sample size, field of study, study design, SDL activity type, SDL assessment method, number of SDL assessments used, study quality, number of SDL components present utilising the framework the authors developed, and SDL activity outcomes. We also assessed relationships between SDL assessment method and number of SDL components, study quality, field of study, and study outcomes. Results: Of the 141 studies included, the majority of study participants were medical (51.8\%) or nursing (34.8\%) students. The most common SDL assessment method used was internallydeveloped perception surveys (49.6\%). When evaluating outcomes for SDL activities, most studies reported a positive or mixed/neutral outcome (58.2\% and 34.8\%, respectively). There was a statistically significant relationship between both number and type of assessments used, and study quality, with knowledge assessments (median-IQR 11.5) being associated with higher study quality (p {$<$} 0.001). Less than half (48.9\%) of the studies used more than one assessment method to evaluate the effectiveness of SDL activities. Having more than one assessment (mean 9.49) was associated with higher quality study (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: The results of our systematic review suggest that SDL assessment practices within undergraduate health professions education vary greatly, as different aspects of SDL were leveraged and implemented by diverse groups of learners to meet different learning needs and professional accreditation requirements. Evidence-based best practices for the assessment of SDL across undergraduate healthcare professions education should include the use of multiple assessments, with direct and indirect measures, to more accurately assess student performance.},

For example, AI could help automate assessment of written responses, or provide feedback on medical image interpretations with excellent reliability. While applications of AI in learning, instruction, and assessment are growing, further exploration is still required. There exist few conceptual or methodological guides for medical educators wishing to evaluate or engage in AI research. In this guide, we aim to: 1) describe practical considerations involved in reading and conducting studies in medical education using AI, 2) define basic terminology and 3) identify which medical education problems and data are ideally-suited for using AI.},

  abstract = {Medical schools and residency programs are increasingly incorporating personalization of content, pathways, and assessments to align with a competency-based model. Yet, such efforts face challenges involving large amounts of data, sometimes struggling to deliver insights in a timely fashion for trainees, coaches, and programs. In this article, the authors argue that the emerging paradigm of precision medical education (PME) may ameliorate some of these challenges. However, PME lacks a widely accepted definition and a shared model of guiding principles and capacities, limiting widespread adoption. The authors propose defining PME as a systematic approach that integrates longitudinal data and analytics to drive precise educational interventions that address each individual learner’s needs and goals in a continuous, timely, and cyclical fashion, ultimately improving meaningful educational, clinical, or system outcomes. Borrowing from precision medicine, they offer an adapted shared framework. In the P4 medical education framework, PME should (1) take a proactive approach to acquiring and using trainee data; (2) generate timely personalized insights through precision analytics (including artificial intelligence and decision-support tools); (3) design precision educational interventions (learning, assessment, coaching, pathways) in a participatory fashion, with trainees at the center as co-producers; and (4) ensure interventions are predictive of meaningful educational, professional, or clinical outcomes. Implementing PME will require new foundational capacities: flexible educational pathways and programs responsive to PME-guided dynamic and competency-based progression; comprehensive longitudinal data on trainees linked to educational and clinical outcomes; shared development of requisite technologies and analytics to effect educational decision-making; and a culture that embraces a precision approach, with research to gather validity evidence for this approach and development efforts targeting new skills needed by learners, coaches, and educational leaders. Anticipating pitfalls in the use of this approach will be important, as will ensuring it deepens, rather than replaces, the interaction of trainees and their coaches.},

  abstract = {For over 30 years, the notion of authentic assessment in higher education has been adopted in academic practice, but it has managed to escape substantial critique. Although there have been multiple definitions and operationalisations of authentic assessment, current practice tends to foreground mimicking of work tasks. Authenticity cannot be completely unmoored from the reality of workplaces, the demands of the discipline, and the overall intended learning outcomes, however, a restricted view of how these aspects are represented in assessment can limit the sector’s ability to prepare graduates who can engage with and shape the changing world. This paper elaborates the multiple challenges that some conceptualisations of authentic assessment contribute to assessment planning, recognising that assessment design always requires compromise. Three theoretical perspectives on authenticity are introduced to open new possibilities for authenticity in assessment. These are (1) psychological authenticity; (2) ontological fidelity; and (3) practice theory perspectives. The final section discusses how learning design might offer a means to operationalise theory. The paper concludes by suggesting that authenticity in assessment continues to hold value for the sector beyond its current uses through stronger theoretical conceptualisation and operationalisation of authenticity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how effective self-assessment training is in improving the self-regulated learning (SRL) ability of operative dentistry students. The secondary aim was to explore students’ attitudes towards self-assessment in clinical settings. INTRODUCTION: Self-assessment has been the focus of dental education research for decades and has been claimed to be cornerstone in the SRL process. METHODS: This is quasi-experimental study conducted at Damascus University Faculty of Dental Medicine, Syria. A modified direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) assessment protocol with a self-assessment component was applied to a convenience sample of students across five clinical encounters in 2022. Data were collected during clinical training on the DOPS form and at the end of the experiment using a structured questionnaire with a single open-ended question. The qualitative part of the study followed a deductive theory-informed content analysis approach, relying on Zimmerman SRL theory. RESULTS: A total number of 32 students participated in the study, eight of whom were male. During the experiment assessment, participants showed overwhelming positive attitudes towards the utility of self-assessment (m ≥ 3.5; max:4) and the overall assessment method (3.3 ≥ m ≥ 3.5; max:4). Cronbach’s alpha for the post-experiment questionnaire was 0.888. A total of 84.4\% of the participants strongly agreed that selfassessment is useful in clinical training. Data collected (qualitative and quantitative) from participants revealed the positive effects of self-assessment on all three phases of SRL, especially the reflection phase. CONCLUSION: Self-assessment practice and training showed positive results in terms of improving SRL and performance in a clinical context; SRL appeared to be affected by self-assessment in all phases (forethought, performance, and reflection). Participants’ perceptions of self-assessment were generally very positive. These findings imply the potential benefits of applying self-assessment training interventions to foster the SRL ability of learners within the clinical context.},

  abstract = {Background: Mandatory training is considered fundamental to establishing and maintaining high standards of professional practice. There is little evidence however, of the training either achieving its required learning outcomes, or delivering improvement in outcomes for patients. Whist organisations may be hitting their compliance target for mandatory training, is the purpose missing the point? This systematic review aims to synthesize and evaluate the efficacy of statutory and mandatory training. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, CNAHL, ERIC and Cochrane Central registers were searched on 23rd May 2023. All research designs were included and reported training had to specify an organisational mandate within a healthcare setting. Data was coded using a modified Kirkpatrick (KP) rating system. Critical appraisal was undertaken using the Modified Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Studies checklist and Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Results: Twenty-five studies were included, featuring 9132 participants and 1348 patient cases audited. Studies described evaluation of mandatory training according to Kirkpatrick’s outcomes levels 1–4b, with the majority (68\%) undertaken in the UK and within acute settings. Training duration varied from 5 min to 3 days. There is a lack of consensus regarding mandatory training rationale, core topics, duration, and optimum refresher training period. Currently, mandatory training does not consistently translate to widescale improvements in safe practice or improved patient outcomes. Conclusions: Due to the lack of international consensus regarding the need for mandated training, most papers originated from countries with centrally administered national health care systems. The rationale for mandating training programmes remains undefined. The assumption that mandatory training is delivering safe practice outcomes is not supported by studies included in this review. The findings of this review offer a basis for further research to be undertaken to assist with the design, facilitation, and impact of mandatory training.},

  abstract = {In the early twentieth century, Mongolia saw the establishment of Western medicine and educational system, supplementing its pre-existing history of eastern medicine. As a lower-middleincome country with vast landmass and low population density, Mongolia’s medical education landscape has evolved significantly. The inception of the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences in 1942 marked a pivotal moment, initiating the modern era of medical sciences and specialized training programs in the country. Initially shaped by Soviet Union-styled medical curriculum, the system has undergone substantial reform since the constitutional shift to a market economy in the 1990s. This transformation aligned the curriculum with international standards and modern educational approach, focusing on producing skilled medical professionals. Presently, over 10 public and private institutions of higher education in Mongolia provide comprehensive undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate training for medical training. These institutions vary in student enrollment, teaching staff, learning environments, and program models, contributing to the diverse landscape of medical education in the country.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Self-regulated learning (SRL) in medical education is important for successful learning and safe patient care. However, supervisors may be unaware of behaviours that explicitly facilitate or inhibit their students' or residents' SRL, therefore this BEME review explores the role of the supervisor in SRL in clinical environments. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review using meta-aggregation was performed, seeking to draw on the knowledge of included studies and the participants those studies represent to create context-rich recommendations that are relevant and applicable to practice. Categories were developed from individual findings and then synthesised in the form of guidance. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. Six categories were developed. A supervisor who facilitates SRL is: adaptive, engaged and supportive, builds trusting relationships, is knowledgeable, learner-centred, and crafts the architecture of the clinical learning environment. CONCLUSIONS: Within the categories, reciprocal trust and dialogue creates a positive cycle of supervisor-learner engagement which facilitates SRL, but due to the power imbalance inherent in the supervisor-learner relationship, the supervisor needs to make the first move. The curriculum has an important role to play in fostering supervisor-learner relationships. Supervisor beliefs about their role, and the architecture of the clinical learning environment can facilitate or inhibit SRL.},

  abstract = {"From the Globe and Mail and New York Times bestselling author of The Power of Habit, an investigation of what makes conversations work, and how we can all learn to be supercommunicators at work and in our lives. We all know people who seem capable of connecting with almost anyone. They are the ones we turn to for advice, the ones who ask deep questions but who also seem to hear what we are trying to say. What do they know about conversation that makes them so special? And what can they tell us about how communication really works? Supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg argues, understand--some by intuition, some by hard-won experience--that there is a science to how human beings connect through words. They understand that whenever we speak, we're actually participating in three distinct conversations: What is this really about? How do we feel? And who are we? They know the importance of recognizing--and then matching--each kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations and hidden beliefs that color and inform everything we say. Our pasts, our values, our affiliations--our identities--shape every discussion we have, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. With his trademark insight and clarity, Duhigg shows readers how to recognize these three conversations--and teaches us the skills we need to navigate them more successfully. Communication, he argues, is a superpower. By bringing readers into jury deliberations and fraught CIA recruitments, into Netflix's company-wide conversations about equity and the writers' room of The Big Bang Theory, we learn why some people are able to make themselves heard--and to hear others--so clearly. We learn how to recognize and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation. In the end, we learn a simple but powerful lesson: We can connect with anyone, as long as we understand how conversations work."-- Provided by publisher},

We assessed STEM courses that exhibit small and large opportunity gaps at a minority-serving, research-intensive university, and evaluated the degree to which their syllabi are learner-centered, according to a previously validated rubric. We specifically chose syllabi as they are often the first interaction students have with a course, establish expectations for course policies and practices, and serve as a proxy for the course environment. We found STEM courses with more learner-centered syllabi had smaller opportunity gaps. The syllabus rubric factor that most correlated with smaller gaps was               Power and Control               , which reflects Student’s Role, Outside Resources, and Syllabus Focus. This work highlights the importance of course syllabi as a tool for instructors to create more inclusive classroom environments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To overcome limitations of open surgery artificial intelligence (AI) models by curating the largest collection of annotated videos and to leverage this AI-ready data set to develop a generalizable multitask AI model capable of real-time understanding of clinically significant surgical behaviors in prospectively collected real-world surgical videos. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study team programmatically queried open surgery procedures on YouTube and manually annotated selected videos to create the AI-ready data set used to train a multitask AI model for 2 proof-of-concept studies, one generating surgical signatures that define the patterns of a given procedure and the other identifying kinematics of hand motion that correlate with surgeon skill level and experience. The Annotated Videos of Open Surgery (AVOS) data set includes 1997 videos from 23 open-surgical procedure types uploaded to YouTube from 50 countries over the last 15 years. Prospectively recorded surgical videos were collected from a single tertiary care academic medical center. Deidentified videos were recorded of surgeons performing open surgical procedures and analyzed for correlation with surgical training. EXPOSURES The multitask AI model was trained on the AI-ready video data set and then retrospectively applied to the prospectively collected video data set. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Analysis of open surgical videos in near real-time, performance on AI-ready and prospectively collected videos, and quantification of surgeon skill. RESULTS Using the AI-ready data set, the study team developed a multitask AI model capable of real-time understanding of surgical behaviors—the building blocks of procedural flow and surgeon skill—across space and time. Through principal component analysis, a single compound skill feature was identified, composed of a linear combination of kinematic hand attributes. This feature was a significant discriminator between experienced surgeons and surgical trainees across 101 prospectively collected surgical videos of 14 operators. For each unit increase in the compound feature value, the odds of the operator being an experienced surgeon were 3.6 times higher (95\% CI, 1.67-7.62; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this observational study, the AVOS-trained model was applied to analyze prospectively collected open surgical videos and identify kinematic descriptors of surgical skill related to efficiency of hand motion. The ability to provide AI-deduced insights into surgical structure and skill is valuable in optimizing surgical skill acquisition and ultimately improving surgical care.},

This review aimed to map the literature regarding AI applications in medical education, core areas of findings, potential candidates for formal systematic review and gaps for future research. Methods: This rapid scoping review, conducted over 16 weeks, employed Arksey and O’Malley’s framework and adhered to STORIES and BEME guidelines. A systematic and comprehensive search across PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and MedEdPublish was conducted without date or language restrictions. Publications included in the review spanned undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education, encompassing both original studies and perspective pieces. Data were charted by multiple author pairs and synthesized into various thematic maps and charts, ensuring a broad and detailed representation of the current landscape. Results: The review synthesized 278 publications, with a majority (68\%) from North American and European regions. The studies covered diverse AI applications in medical education, such as AI for admissions, teaching, assessment, and clinical reasoning. The review highlighted AI’s varied roles, from augmenting traditional educational methods to introducing innovative practices, and underscores the urgent need for ethical guidelines in AI’s application in medical education. Conclusion: The current literature has been charted. The findings underscore the need for ongoing research to explore uncharted areas and address potential risks associated with AI use in medical education. This work serves as a foundational resource for educators, policymakers, and researchers in navigating AI’s evolving role in medical education. A framework to support future high utility reporting is proposed, the FACETS framework.},

A review of the literature about self-regulated learning strategies reveals both significant and non-significant effects on learning outcomes in online and blended environments. The aim of this study was to calculate the common effect size of empirical studies conducted between 2017 and 2022 that investigated the effect of self-regulated learning strategies on learning outcomes in online and blended environments, and to determine whether the common effect size shows a significant difference in terms of course type, self-regulated learning strategy type, school level, and learning context. A meta-analytical review method was employed to combine the outcome of independent empirical studies. The studies included in this review were collected from Scopus, IEEE Explore, and ERIC databases. A total of 15 studies were included in this study. Cohen’s d coefficient was calculated for the effect size in this study. As the heterogeneity among the effect sizes of the studies was high (Q {$>$} χ2, p {$<$} .05), the common effect size was calculated following the random effects model. As a result of the meta-analysis, it was decided that self-regulated learning strategies had a “moderate” effect (Q= 0.65) on learning outcomes in online and blended environments. Moreover, the calculated common effect size showed no significant difference according to the type of self-regulated learning strategy, course type, school level, and learning context.},

  abstract = {Curriculum change is relatively frequent in health professional education. Formal, planned curriculum review must be conducted periodically to incorporate new knowledge and skills, changing teaching and learning methods or changing roles and expectations of graduates. Unplanned curriculum evolution arguably happens continually, usually taking the form of “minor” changes that in combination over time may produce a substantially different programme. However, reviewing assessment practices is less likely to be a major consideration during curriculum change, overlooking the potential for unintended consequences for learning. This includes potentially undermining or negating the impact of even well-designed and important curriculum changes. Changes to any component of the curriculum “ecosystem “- graduate outcomes, content, delivery or assessment of learning – should trigger an automatic review of the whole ecosystem to maintain constructive alignment. Consideration of potential impact on assessment is essential to support curriculum change. Powerful contextual drivers of a curriculum include national examinations and programme accreditation, so each assessment programme sits within its own external context. Internal drivers are also important, such as adoption of new learning technologies and learning preferences of students and faculty. Achieving optimal and sustainable outcomes from a curriculum review requires strong governance and support, stakeholder engagement, curriculum and assessment expertise and internal quality assurance processes. This consensus paper provides guidance on managing assessment during curriculum change, building on evidence and the contributions of previous consensus papers.},

  abstract = {Background: The medical education research study quality instrument (MERSQI) was designed to appraise medical education research quality based on study design criteria. As with many such tools, application of the results may have unintended consequences. This study applied the MERSQI to published medical education research identified in a bibliometric analysis. Methods: A bibliometric analysis identified highly cited articles in medical education that two authors independently evaluated using the MERSQI. After screening duplicate or non-research articles, the authors reviewed 21 articles with the quality instrument. Initially, five articles were reviewed independently and results were compared to ensure agreed upon understanding of the instru­ ment items. The remainder of the articles were independently reviewed. Overall scores for the articles were analyzed with a paired samples t-test and individual item ratings were analyzed for inter-rater reliability. Results: There was a significant difference in mean MERSQI score between reviewers. Inter-rater reliability for MERSQI items labeled response rate, validity and outcomes were considered unacceptable. Conclusions: Based on these results there is evidence that MERSQI items can be significantly influenced by interpretation, which lead to a difference in scoring. The MERSQI is a useful guide for identifying research methodologies. However, it should not be used to make judgments on the overall quality of medical education research methodol­ ogy in its current format. The authors make specific recommendations for how the instrument could be revised for greater clarity and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of implementing various audience response system (ARS) formats in large classes to engage students, positively influence academic outcomes, and align with their preferences for different types of activities lacked sufficient information. This study aimed to (1) evaluate students’ perspectives on different ARS formats, including Kahoot for individual (Kahoot-I) and team (Kahoot-T) play, and Google Forms and Google Sheets for multiple-choice questions (Google-MCQ) and for open-ended questions (Google-OEQ) on different aspects with/without subgroup analysis of students into quartiles (Q1-lowest-Q4-highest) of summative scores, and (2) determine correlations between students’ perspectives and academic outcomes. At the course’s final class, a QR code for a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was displayed for all enrolled medical students. 269/312 students (86.22\%) provided written consent and completed the questionnaire constructed based on dimensions of student engagement. Across all ARS formats, students rated scores\,≥\,4 for almost all aspects, with participation in class receiving the highest scores. For each aspect, Kahoot-T was rated highest in various aspects and Google-MCQ for “understanding” and Google-OEQ for “asking/answering question”. Higher academic achievers expressed more “enthusiasm” for Kahoot-I than lower achievers (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Formative and summative scores were positively correlated with many aspects. Students reported high engagement with all ARS formats, with higher academic achievers rating them with higher scores. Kahoot-T was the most favored for multiple aspects, Google-MCQ for “understanding” and Google-OEQ for interactive “asking/answering question”. Thus, selecting ARS in alignment with learning objective could enhance students’ engagement and learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: The 2021 Doctor of Medicine curriculum underwent extensive revisions, including specific Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) design, a shift from compensatory to non-compensatory evaluation, and grading to non-grading evaluation as Outstanding-"O", Satisfactory-"S", and Unsatisfactory-"U". Each CLO assessment allowed unlimited attempts. Summary of Work: This study analyzed data on CLO behaviors and academic performance of first-year medical students, academic year 2021 (n=320), to define the appropriate attempt number for each CLO. Results: For each CLO, mean and median attempts were 2.6-14.9 and 2-8 for total attempts, 2.1-7.6 and 2-7 for intentional attempts, 1.44-4.61 and 1-3 for the first-pass attempt, and 0.852.95 and 0-1 for additional attempts after passing. Highest-scoring attempts ranged from 1.986.84 (mean) and 2-5 (median). "O" students excelled with fewer total CLO attempts than "S"/"U", and "S" students attempted fewer than "U". Summative scores positively correlated with CLO scores, intentional attempts, attempts passing each CLO, and additional attempts but negatively correlated with total attempts and the first-pass attempt. Discussion: Students attempted CLOs multiple times, reflecting their commitment to mastery. "O" students achieved higher scores with fewer total attempts compared to "S" and/or "U" students and also "S" compared to "U" students. Summative scores correlated positively with CLO performance and attempts passing each CLO, suggesting that high formative performance predicted good summative outcomes. However, negative correlations with total attempts and first-pass attempts call for optimizing learning strategies. Conclusions: The non-grading evaluation and unlimited attempts fostered a growth mindset, encouraging students to focus on learning rather than grades. Top performers demonstrated efficient learning. Persistence and performance in individual CLOs influenced academic outcomes. Take home messages: 1) Non-grading evaluation with unlimited CLO attempts enhances engagement and learning. 2) Tailored interventions and support can improve students' learnin outcomes. 3) Factors influencing learning behaviors should be further investigated to optimize curriculum and support systems.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Professional identity formation is a complex construct that continually evolves in relation to an individual’s experiences. The literature on educators identifying as faculty developers is limited and incompletely addresses how that identify affects other identities, careers, and influences on teaching. Twenty-six health professionals were trained to serve as faculty developers within our educational system. We sought to examine the factors that influence the professional identity of these faculty developers and to determine whether a common trajectory existed. Methods: We employed a constructivist thematic analysis methodology using an inductive approach to understand the experiences of faculty developers. We conducted semistructured recorded interviews. Coding and thematic analysis were completed iteratively. Results: We identified eight primary themes: (1) initial invitation, (2) discovery of faculty development as a professional activity, (3) discovery of educational theory, skills, and need for more education, (4) process of time and experience, (5) fostering relationships and community, (6) transfer of skills to professional and personal roles, (7) experiences that lead to credibility, and (8) sense of greater impact. Conclusions: An individual’s journey to a faculty developer identity is variable, with several shared pivotal experiences that help foster the emergence of this identity. Consideration of specific programmatic elements to support the themes identified might allow for a strategic approach to faculty development efforts in health professions education.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Emergency departments (ED) worldwide have to cope with rising patient numbers. Low-acuity consulters who could receive a more suitable treatment in primary care (PC) increase caseloads, and lack of PC attachment has been discussed as a determinant. This qualitative study explores factors that contribute to nonutilization of general practitioner (GP) care among patients with no current attachment to a GP. Method\enspace{} Qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 32 low-acuity ED consulters with no self-reported attachment to a GP. Participants were recruited from three EDs in the city center of Berlin, Germany. Data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Results\enspace{} Interviewed patients reported heterogeneous factors contributing to their PC utilization behavior and underlying views and experiences. Participants most prominently voiced a rare need for medical services, a distinct mobility behavior, and a lack of knowledge about the role of a GP and health care options. Views about and experiences with GP care that contribute to non-utilization were predominantly related to little confidence in GP care, preference for directly consulting medical specialists, and negative experiences with GP care in the past. Contrasting their reported utilization behavior, many interviewees still recognized the advantages of GP care continuity. Conclusion\enspace{} Understanding reasons of low-acuity ED patients for GP non-utilization can play an important role in the design and implementation of patient-centered care interventions for PC integration. Increasing GP utilization, continuity of care and health literacy might have positive effects on patient decision-making in acute situations and in turn decrease ED burden.

In this article, the authors, all leaders of medical student well-being programs at their home institutions and members of the Association of American Medical Colleges Group on Student Affairs Committee on Student Affairs Working Group on Medical Student Well-Being between 2019 and 2023, offer guidance to the national community on how best to structure a UME well-being program. They use the current literature and their professional experiences leading well-being efforts at 7 different institutions to review the case for addressing medical student well-being, propose a guiding model, and make recommendations for strategies to implement this model.             The proposed guiding model emphasizes the importance of the learning environment and efficiency of learning to medical student well-being, as well as personal resilience. Based on this model, the authors recommend specific and tangible well-being strategies to implement systemic interventions to improve the learning environment, efficiency of learning, and personal resilience, including: formalizing the well-being program; hiring qualified, dedicated, and empowered well-being leadership with clear responsibilities; acting as a central hub for resources and as a liaison with mental health care; and establishing robust program evaluation methods.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The reflective pause, taking a pause during performance to reflect, is an important practice in simulation-based learning. However, for novice learners, it is a highly complex self-regulatory skill that cannot stand alone without guidance. Using educational theories, we propose how to design cognitive and metacognitive aids to guide learners with the reflective pause and investigate its effects on performance in a simulation training environment. Methods: These effects are examined in four aspects of performance: cognitive load, primary performance, secondary performance, and encapsulation. Medical students (N = 72) performed tasks in simulation training for emergency medicine, under 2 conditions: reflection condition (n = 36) where reflection was prompted and guided, and control condition (n = 36) without such reflection. Results: The effects of reflective pauses emerged for 2 aspects of performance: cognitive load decreased and secondary performance improved. However, primary performance and encapsulation did not show significant difference. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that reflective pauses with cognitive and metacognitive aids implemented can enhance some aspects of performance. We suggest that to secure these effects, feedback during reflection and an adaptation period should be provided.},

Despite the prevalent use of learning analytics in this regard, little attention has been paid to systematically surveying and summarising relevant latest work. To address the literature gap, this paper reviews the use of learning analytics to support prediction of atrisk students. The study covers 138 research articles published between 2013 and 2022 which were collected from the Scopus database. Through a content analysis approach, the relevant work was examined in terms of the prediction objectives, the types of data collected, the techniques used for prediction, and the metrics employed for evaluation of prediction performance. The findings reveal a strong scholarly interest in the prediction of students’ learning performance to identify those who are potentially at risk. The common types of data collected are related to students’ previous academic performance, socio-demographics, and learning behaviours, particularly those on learning management systems. The most frequently used techniques for prediction are decision trees, neural networks, and Bayesian networks. The results also show the widespread use of classification accuracy, recall, sensitivity, and true positive rate as the performance metrics. The findings contribute to advancing our understanding about the potential of learning analytics for at-risk student prediction, as well as informing the provision of timely and proper support for specific student groups.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the past, present, and future of medical education in Cambodia. Although doctor training began in 1902, the first medical school was not founded until 1946. Since the colonial era, the curriculum and teaching strategies have been strongly influenced by the French system, dominated by didactic lectures and the apprenticeship model. Three chronic issues have plagued medical education in the country following the Khmer Rouge regime: a shortage of doctors, poor-quality training, and lack of relevance to the current and future population needs. An increasing number of medical schools and yearly student enrollment have addressed the first issue. Today, the fundamental challenges have shifted from quantity to ensuring the quality and relevance of medical education. Competency-based medical education (CBME) has been adopted as a new curricular model to tackle the latter two issues. Active collaboration between government institutions, public universities, and development partners drives this curricular reform at the national and institutional levels. This paper further examines the challenges associated with medical education and proposes recommendations.},

  abstract = {Multiple-choice items are universally used in formal education. Since they should assess learning, not test-wiseness or guesswork, they must be constructed following the highest possible standards. Hundreds of item-writing guides have provided guidelines to help test developers adopt appropriate strategies to define the distribution and sequence of correct answers across tests and, thus, not inadvertently provide clues to correct responses. In this study, these option placement guidelines were systematically reviewed. Consensual recommendations and recommendations from the most theoretically sound guides were identified. Additionally, results from empirical studies evaluating the effect of option position on examinees’ responses and research reports on where test developers place correct answers in tests were considered to better examine these recommendations’ relevance and suitability. Consistent and easy-to-follow recommendations about where and how to place options in items and tests are finally provided so that developers can gauge the adequacy of their option placement strategies.},

  abstract = {By virtue of their teaching role and contact with students, health professions (HP) educators are often the first point of connection for students who are experiencing mental health difficulties. Educators are increasingly expected to include some form of pastoral care in their role. Mental health-related interactions with students may have a negative emotional impact on educators, particularly when roles and expectations are not clearly defined and where boundaries are not managed effectively. Using positioning theory as a lens, this study explored how educators experienced such interactions and how this manifested in positions, storylines, and speech acts. Interviews were conducted with 27 HP educators at a faculty of medicine and health sciences. Reflexive thematic analysis using inductive coding identified themes corresponding to the nearing, weighted, ambivalent, and distancing positions participants adopted in relation to students with mental health difficulties. There was fluidity in and between positions, and more than one position could be occupied simultaneously; participants each moved through different positions in response to different relational situations. Multiple storylines informed these positions, representing how moral- and care-informed responsibility intersected with responsiveness to make certain actions possible or impossible. Normative and personal value narratives were evident in storylines, in many cases underscored by care or justice ethics. The value of positioning theory in facilitating reflective faculty development initiatives for educators engaged in these interactions is discussed.},

  abstract = {The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2021, 2022), which seeks to explain how people learn academic material from words and graphics, has developed over the past four decades. Although the name and graphical representation of the theory have evolved over the years, the core ideas have been constant—dual channels (i.e., humans have separate information processing channels for verbal and visual information), limited capacity (i.e., processing capacity is severely limited), and active processing (i.e., meaningful learning involves selecting relevant material to be processed in working memory, mentally organizing the material into coherent verbal and visual structures, and integrating them with each other and with relevant knowledge activated from long-term memory). This review describes how the theory has developed (i.e., the past), the current state of the theory (i.e., the present), and new directions for future development (i.e., the future). In addition, the review includes examples of the events and findings that led to changes in the theory. Implications for educational psychology are discussed, including 15 evidence-based principles of multimedia design.},

The certainty of evidence was very low due to a high risk of bias and inconsistency. Heterogeneity prevented any metaanalysis. Limited evidence showed benefit for confidence, technical skills, and nontechnical skills. No significant difference was found in knowledge outcomes and teamwork abilities between lower and higher fidelity simulation. Participants reported higher satisfaction but also higher stress with higher fidelity materials. Both higher and lower fidelity simulation can be beneficial for team training, with higher fidelity simulation preferred by participants if resources allow.

  abstract = {Recent research has identified a unique population of 'Lean Mass Hyper-Responders' (LMHR) who exhibit increases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in  response to carbohydrate-restricted diets to levels ≥ 200 mg/dL, in association  with HDL cholesterol ≥ 80 mg/dL and triglycerides ≤ 70 mg/dL. This triad of  markers occurs primarily in lean metabolically healthy subjects, with the  magnitude of increase in LDL-C inversely associated with body mass index. The  lipid energy model has been proposed as one explanation for LMHR phenotype and  posits that there is increased export and subsequent turnover of VLDL to LDL  particles to meet systemic energy needs in the setting of hepatic glycogen  depletion and low body fat. This single subject crossover experiment aimed to  test the hypothesis that adding carbohydrates, in the form of Oreo cookies, to an  LMHR subject on a ketogenic diet would reduce LDL-C levels by a similar, or  greater, magnitude than high-intensity statin therapy. The study was designed as  follows: after a 2-week run-in period on a standardized ketogenic diet, study arm  1 consisted of supplementation with 12 regular Oreo cookies, providing 100 g/d of  additional carbohydrates for 16 days. Throughout this arm, ketosis was monitored  and maintained at levels similar to the subject's standard ketogenic diet using  supplemental exogenous d-β-hydroxybutyrate supplementation four times daily.  Following the discontinuation of Oreo supplementation, the subject maintained a  stable ketogenic diet for 3 months and documented a return to baseline weight and  hypercholesterolemic status. During study arm 2, the subject received  rosuvastatin 20 mg daily for 6 weeks. Lipid panels were drawn water-only fasted  and weekly throughout the study. Baseline LDL-C was 384 mg/dL and reduced to 111  mg/dL (71\% reduction) after Oreo supplementation. Following the washout period,  LDL-C returned to 421 mg/dL, and was reduced to a nadir of 284 mg/dL with 20 mg  rosuvastatin therapy (32.5\% reduction). In conclusion, in this case study  experiment, short-term Oreo supplementation lowered LDL-C more than 6 weeks of  high-intensity statin therapy in an LMHR subject on a ketogenic diet. This  dramatic metabolic demonstration, consistent with the lipid energy model, should  provoke further research and not be seen as health advice.},

We inves­ tigated whether Klark could enhance student confidence and competence in history-taking, and whether students find Klark helpful. Methods: A single cohort of first-year clinical medical students had access to Klark for three weeks. At both ends of the trial, participants were asked to complete feedback forms and participate in two mock Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) history stations. Outcome measures included self-reported confidence and competence in history-taking, performance in OSCE stations, and qualitative user experience data. Results: Seventy participants successfully completed a case on Klark (mean 18.7), of which 63 (90\% user retention) completed � 2 cases. Self-reported competence (p {$<$} 0.001) and confidence (p {$<$} 0.001) improved. Participants found Klark to be helpful, impactful, and would recommend it to other students. OSCE scores improved for medical (57\% vs. 69\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and surgical (58\% vs. 70\%, p {$<$} 0.001) histories. Conclusions: Klark improved competence and confidence in history-taking. Students found it help­ ful and chose to continue using the platform. By developing confidence and competence at their own pace in the Klark simulated environment, students can then maximise benefit from in-person clinical opportunities.},

Each CLO assessment allowed unlimited attempts. Summary of Work: This study analyzed data on CLO behaviors and academic performance of first-year medical students, academic year 2021 (n=320), to define the appropriate attempt number for each CLO. Results: For each CLO, mean and median attempts were 2.6-14.9 and 2-8 for total attempts, 2.1-7.6 and 2-7 for intentional attempts, 1.44-4.61 and 1-3 for the first-pass attempt, and 0.852.95 and 0-1 for additional attempts after passing. Highest-scoring attempts ranged from 1.986.84 (mean) and 2-5 (median). "O" students excelled with fewer total CLO attempts than "S"/"U", and "S" students attempted fewer than "U". Summative scores positively correlated with CLO scores, intentional attempts, attempts passing each CLO, and additional attempts but negatively correlated with total attempts and the first-pass attempt. Discussion: Students attempted CLOs multiple times, reflecting their commitment to mastery. "O" students achieved higher scores with fewer total attempts compared to "S" and/or "U" students and also "S" compared to "U" students. Summative scores correlated positively with CLO performance and attempts passing each CLO, suggesting that high formative performance predicted good summative outcomes. However, negative correlations with total attempts and first-pass attempts call for optimizing learning strategies. Conclusions: The non-grading evaluation and unlimited attempts fostered a growth mindset, encouraging students to focus on learning rather than grades. Top performers demonstrated efficient learning. Persistence and performance in individual CLOs influenced academic outcomes. Take home messages: 1) Non-grading evaluation with unlimited CLO attempts enhances engagement and learning. 2) Tailored interventions and support can improve students' learnin outcomes. 3) Factors influencing lear},

This criterion was introduced by Lincoln and Guba to describe the degree to which a study's findings can be transferred to other contexts, settings or respondents. In this How To paper, we present a more nuanced, multidimensional view of transferability and explain relevant concepts, reflexive approaches and specific techniques to guide researchers in discussing transferability. We identify three dimensions of transferability for use in many approaches to qualitative research: applicability, resonance and theoretical engagement. Transferability as applicability relates to providing sufficient information for readers to evaluate the relevance of findings to other contexts. Transferability as resonance requires the researcher to present the research in a way that evokes a sense of familiarity or shared experience. Transferability as theoretical engagement refers to ways the researcher uses theory to frame a problem, connects findings to existing constructs and/or proposes a model or theory that could explain a process or phenomenon. We encourage researchers to consider all three dimensions of transferability when developing and presenting their work, keeping in mind that some dimensions may be more relevant than others based on study methodology and project goals.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a drive to emphasize professional identity formation in medical education. This shift has had important and positive implications for the education of physicians. However, the increasing recognition of longstanding structural inequalities within society and the profession has highlighted how conceptualizations of professional identity formation have also had unintended harmful consequences. These include experiences of identity threat and exclusion, and the promotion of norms and values that over-emphasize the preferences of culturally dominant groups. In this paper, the authors put forth a reconceptualization of the process of professional identity formation in medicine through the elaboration of 3 schematic representations. Evolutions in the understandings of professional identity formation, as described in this paper, include re-defining socialization as an active process involving critical engagement with professional norms, emphasizing the role of agency, and recognizing the importance of belonging or exclusion on one’s sense of professional self. The authors have framed their analysis as an evidence-informed educational guide with the aim of supporting the development of identities which embrace diverse ways of being, becoming, and belonging within the profession, while simultaneously upholding the standards required for the profession to meet its obligations to patients and society.},

PT work is a balancing act between respecting the confidential information divulged by students and doing what is expected in terms of accountability and duty of care. We aimed to explore how tutors manage this tension, with the aim of advancing understanding of student support programmes.   Methods: This qualitative study was informed by an Institutional Ethnography approach. We conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with PTs from one medical school in Singapore. We considered how they worked in relation to relevant national and institutional-level policy documents and reporting guidelines. Data collection and analysis were iterative.   Results: We crafted two composite accounts to illustrate the dilemmas faced by PTs. The first depicts a PT who supports student confidentiality in the same way as doctor-patient confidentiality. The second account is a PT who adopted a more mentoring approach. Both tutors faced confidentiality challenges, using different strategies to “work around” and balance tensions between accountability and maintaining trust. PTs were torn between school and student expectations.   Discussion: Fostering trust in the tutor-student relationship is a priority for tutors but tensions between confidentiality, accountability and governance sometimes make it difficult for tutors to reconcile with doing what they think is best for the student. A more nuanced understanding of the concept of confidentiality may help support PTs and ultimately students.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study explores international trends and standards of Master’s degree programs through a comprehensive environmental scan and focus group interviews to understand curricular structure, content, program director expectations, educational context, and future directions. Method: Authors conducted a two-phase mixed-methods sequential explanatory design to conduct the environmental scan (phase 1), and subsequently conducting focus groups (phase 2) with program directors. A population list of Master’s programs was used to generate a sampling frame, considering the geographic region (continent) and institution type (university, organization, public institution). Qualitative data were coded to analyze the breadth and depth of courses. Three onehour virtual focus group interviews were conducted with ten program directors. Results: The population list of 159 Masters programs worldwide was used to create a sample for analysis in the environmental scan (n ¼ 46 Masters programs), representing programs from North America, Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Most programs (39\%) delivered their courses online, with 20\% exclusively offering an in-person program. Focus group participants indicated expectations of graduates, context in which they learn, as well as future directions for improving health professions education graduate programs. Conclusion: Program directors should consider programmatic aims, localized needs, and quality/ standard of the program in designing Masters programs, with individualized growth opportunities for learners.},

  abstract = {Visual problem-solving is an essential skill for professionals in various visual domains. Novices in these domains acquire such skills through interactions with experts (e.g., apprenticeships). Experts guide novice visual problem-solving with scaffolding behaviours. However, there is little consensus about the description and classification of scaffolding behaviours in practice, and to our knowledge, no framework connects scaffolding to underlying cognitive mechanisms. Understanding effective scaffolding is particularly relevant to domain-specific expert-novice research regarding visual problem-solving, where in-person scaffolding by an expert is a primary teaching method. Scaffolding regulates the flow of information within the learner’s working memory, thereby reducing cognitive load. By examining scaffolding research from the perspective of cognitive load theory, we aspire to classify scaffolding behaviours as cognitive behaviours of cueing (which involves attention allocation) and chunking (the practice of grouping information, often in conjunction with prior knowledge), into a cohesive and unified framework. In this scoping review, 6533 articles were considered, from which 18 were included. From these 18 articles, 164 excerpts describing expert-novice interaction were examined and categorised based on cognitive strategy (cueing or chunking) and method of expression (verbal or nonverbal). An inductive category (active or passive) was also identified and coded. Most scaffolding behaviours were categorised as active verbal cueing and active verbal chunking. Qualitative patterns in excerpts were collated into 12 findings. Our framework may help to integrate existing and new scaffolding research, form the basis for future expert-novice interaction research, and provide insights into the fine-grained processes that comprise scaffolded visual problem-solving.},

  abstract = {Background: Technological innovations such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) are becoming more and more prevalent in the learning environments of students. Distilling and acting on knowledge gathered from these systems, the field known as learning analytics, allows educators to hone their craft and support students more effectively by providing timely interventions. Objectives: While most learning analytics studies focus on using LMS data to predict performance, this study instead predicts students' self-reported time-management skills using trace data from the Canvas LMS. This is done for courses at one Dutch technical university with in total 462 students. Methods: Linear regression and multi-level regression models are constructed using both theory and findings from previous research. The predictions made by these models are compared to previously filled in questionnaire data to validate the results. Results: Our results show that models can be constructed and time-management can be predicted for individual courses. Furthermore, there are several predictors that are significant in multiple models. However, these models and predictions are not immediately transferable to other courses. Conclusions: The study therefore emphasizes the need for further research, using multiple sources of data or more theoretically grounded predictors, to investigate the extent of the portability issues with these predictive models. Despite this we were able to predict the students' self-reported time-management skills in multiple different courses using Learning Analytics, and managed to identify multiple consistently predictive trace data variables.},

  abstract = {Authentic assessments are designed to evaluate knowledge and skills that are relevant for students’ life beyond university, emphasising practical, applied skills. They offer an alternative to assessments that don’t explicitly foster transferability of skills. The present study examined undergraduate student perceptions of authentic and traditional assessments (N=150). We used a qualitative story completion methodology to examine three domains: student’s emotional responses to authentic and traditional assessment forms, student’s perceptions of how different assessment types may benefit their employability, and student’s preferences for pedagogical support with authentic assessments. A qualitative content analysis revealed students generally perceive authentic, novel assessments to be exciting, motivating and inspirational; however, this was accompanied by feelings of uncertainty and unfamiliarity. More traditional assessments (e.g. essays and multiple-choice-question examinations) elicited feelings of comfort and preparedness, but students also felt worried, bored and unexcited by these assessments. Students appreciated creative freedom when lecturers set traditional assessments but would like more consideration of their feelings and need for support in authentic assessments. Hence, we argue, when advocating for authentic assessment, there is a balance to be struck between innovation and challenge, ensuring sufficient support for student’s psychological safety and feelings of comfort. Implications for practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although every student of memory knows about the Atkinson-Shiffrin (1968) model, few know that it was advanced as a general-purpose modeling framework, not as the specific theoretical instantiation that appears in textbooks today. Largely missing from the historical record is the broader theoretical perspective proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968), one that is surprisingly consistent with contemporary views of human memory. For example, they described "working memory" (using those words) as consisting of a verbal short-term store and a visual short-term store. In addition, using logic that still makes sense today, they justified the distinction between short-term store and long-term store based on the memory profile of the amnesic patient HM, whose verbal shortterm store was largely intact despite his inability to form long-term memories. Finally, they explained that some "coding processes" are more effective than others in transferring information from short-term store to long-term store, a perspective that is consistent with the subsequently proposed notion of "depth of processing." Given its preeminent status in the history of human memory research and its enduring influence on the field today, Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 chapter is reproduced here so that students of memory, including textbook writers, can better appreciate the surprisingly modern ideas they actually proposed.},

It has served as the academic home of internationally preeminent scholars, including Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann, Michael Walzer, Clifford Geertz and Kurt Gödel, many of whom had emigrated from Europe to the United States. It was founded in 1930 by American educator Abraham Flexner, together with philanthropists Louis Bamberger and Caroline Bamberger Fuld. Despite collaborative ties and neighboring geographic location, the institute, being independent, has "no formal links" with Princeton University. The institute does not charge tuition or fees. Flexner's guiding principle in founding the institute was the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. The faculty have no classes to teach. There are no degree programs or experimental facilities at the institute. Research is never contracted or directed. It is left to each individual researcher to pursue their own goals. Established during the rise of fascism in Europe, the institute played a key role in the transfer of intellectual capital from Europe to America. It quickly earned its reputation as the pinnacle of academic and scientific life—a reputation it has retained. The institute consists of four schools: Historical Studies, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. The institute also has a program in Systems Biology. It is supported entirely by endowments, grants, and gifts. It is one of eight American mathematics institutes funded by the National Science Foundation. It is the model for all ten members of the consortium Some Institutes for Advanced Study.},

  abstract = {Background: The Script Concordance Test (SCT) is increasingly used in professional development to assess clinical reasoning, with linear progression in SCT performance observed as clinical experience increases. One challenge in implementing SCT is the potential burnout of expert reference panel (ERP) members. To address this, we introduced ChatGPT as panel members. The aim was to enhance the efficiency of SCT creation while maintaining educational content quality and to explore the effectiveness of different models as reference panels. Methodology: A quasi-experimental comparative design was employed, involving all undergraduate medical students and faculty members enrolled in the Ophthalmology clerkship. Two groups involved Traditional ERP which consisted of 15 experts, diversified in clinical experience: 5 senior residents, 5 lecturers, and 5 professors and AI-Generated ERP which is a panel generated using ChatGPT and o1 preview, designed to mirror diverse clinical opinions based on varying experience levels. Results: Experts consistently achieved the highest mean scores across most vignettes, with ChatGPT-4 and o1 scores generally slightly lower. Notably, the o1 mean scores were closer to those of experts compared to ChatGPT-4. Significant differences were observed between ChatGPT4 and o1 scores in certain vignettes. These values indicate a strong level of consistency, suggesting that both experts and AI models provided highly reliable ratings. Conclusion: These findings suggest that while AI models cannot replace human experts, they can be effectively used to train students, enhance reasoning skills, and help narrow the gap between student and expert performance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using probably blinded (ie, rated by individuals probably or certainly unaware of treatment allocation) or neuropsychological outcomes to test the efficacy of neurofeedback as a treatment for ADHD in terms of core symptom reduction and improved neuropsychological outcomes. DATA SOURCES PubMed (MEDLINE), Ovid (PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase + Embase Classic), and Web of Science, as well as the reference lists of eligible records and relevant systematic reviews, were searched until July 25, 2023, with no language limits. STUDY SELECTION Parallel-arm RCTs investigating neurofeedback in participants of any age with a clinical ADHD or hyperkinetic syndrome diagnosis were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with Hedges g correction were pooled in random effects meta-analyses for all eligible outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was ADHD total symptom severity assessed at the first postintervention time point, focusing on reports by individuals judged probably or certainly unaware of treatment allocation (probably blinded). Secondary outcomes were inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and neuropsychological outcomes postintervention and at a longer-term follow-up (ie, after the last follow-up time point). RCTs were assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool version 2.0. RESULTS A total of 38 RCTs (2472 participants aged 5 to 40 years) were included. Probably blinded reports of ADHD total symptoms showed no significant improvement with neurofeedback (k = 20; n = 1214; SMD, 0.04; 95\% CI, −0.10 to 0.18). A small significant improvement was seen when analyses were restricted to RCTs using established standard protocols (k = 9; n = 681; SMD, 0.21; 95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.40). Results remained similar with adults excluded or when analyses were restricted to RCTs where cortical learning or self-regulation was established. Of the 5 neuropsychological outcomes analyzed, a significant but small improvement was observed only for processing speed (k = 15; n = 909; SMD, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.69). Heterogeneity was generally low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall, neurofeedback did not appear to meaningfully benefit individuals with ADHD, clinically or neuropsychologically, at the group level. Future studies seeking to identify individuals with ADHD who may benefit from neurofeedback could focus on using standard neurofeedback protocols, measuring processing speed, and leveraging advances in precision medicine, including neuroimaging technology.},

  abstract = {Background: Many patients with COVID-19 have been treated with plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods: This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing several possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 177 NHS hospitals from across the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus high-titre convalescent plasma (convalescent plasma group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. Findings: Between May 28, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, 11558 (71\%) of 16287 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible to receive convalescent plasma and were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1399 (24\%) of 5795 patients in the convalescent plasma group and 1408 (24\%) of 5763 patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·00, 95\% CI 0·93–1·07; p=0·95). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (3832 [66\%] patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 3822 [66\%] patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95\% CI 0·94–1·03; p=0·57). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1568 [29\%] of 5493 patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 1568 [29\%] of 5448 patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95\% CI 0·93–1·05; p=0·79). Interpretation: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Funding: UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) as the non-medical factors influencing health outcomes. SDOH is associated with conditions in which people are born, grow, work, and live. Medical schools and licensing bodies are increasingly recognizing the need for doctors and healthcare professionals to be aware of their patient's social context and how it impacts their states of health and disease. However, there is considerable variation in the approaches of different institutions and countries to incorporating SDOH into their curricula. In order to allow clinicians to adopt a holistic approach to patient health, equipping them with extensive knowledge of SDOH would give learners the confidence, skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to effectively engage with patients and their families . This approach aids health professionals with knowledge of the influence of the social context and cultural factors that affect patients' behaviors in relation to health. Incorporating the SDOH in medical and health professional school curricula would contribute towards adequately preparing future healthcare practitioners to provide effective, comprehensive, and equitable care, especially to marginalized and underserved populations. The Guide will take an evidence-based approach grounded in the available contemporary literature and case studies. The focus will be on integrating SDOH into undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula to promote an understanding of the social factors that influence patients' and communities' health. Ultimately, this guide seeks to contribute to the reduction of inequalities in health.},

  abstract = {Background: There is an increasing trend toward transcending from traditional teaching to student-centered methodologies that actively engage students. We aimed to analyze students’ perceptions of effective interactive teaching using PollEverywhere Audience Response System (ARS) as a worthwhile teaching methodology. It can be of great help in maintaining students’ attention and in facilitating the lecturer to pick up students’ misunderstandings and correct them. Materials and methods: This system was introduced to the undergraduate dental curriculum to increase student’s motivation and attention, giving immediate feedback on student understanding during an anatomy module. Computer science (CS) students who were more familiar with the use of this technology were also involved in the study for comparison and validation of the findings. The lecturer strategically inserted questions using PollEverywhere ARS. Students’ perception of the effective interactive teaching using this technology was evaluated statistically using a questionnaire and focus groups. Results: It promoted interactivity, focused attention, and provided feedback on comprehension. A total of 95\% reported that it increased their participation and found that it clarified their thinking and helped to focus on key points. Another 81.7\% mentioned that it increased their motivation to learn. Students regarded it as a useful method for giving real-time feedback, which stimulated their performance and participation. Data from CS students echoed the findings from the dental students. Reports from focus groups demonstrated that this strategy was helpful in focusing students’ attention and in clarifying information. Discussion: PollEverywhere encouraged all students to participate during the learning process. This has proven to be an effective tool for improving students’ understanding and critical thinking. Conclusion: Students regarded PollEverywhere as an effective teaching innovation that encouraged deeper ongoing retention of information. It was found to be an effective teaching aid in monitoring students’ progress and identifying deficiencies. This is of benefit in a module where interactivity is considered important.},

Methods: MEDLINE complete, CINHAL complete, EMBASE, PSNet and Google Advanced. Electronic and manual search of articles on audit systems and communication strategies or interventions, searched for papers published between January 1990 and April 2017. We included studies with interventions implemented by clinicians in a clinical environment with real patients. Results: A total of 2431 articles were screened of which 26 studies met inclusion criteria. Data extraction was conducted by two groups, each group comprising two independent reviewers. Articles were classified by communication (6) or audit strategies (20) to reduce diagnostic error in clinical settings. The most common interventions were delivered as technology-based systems n = 16 (62\%) and within an acute care setting n = 15 (57\%). Nine studies reported randomised controlled trials. Three RCT studies on communication interventions and 3 RCTs on audit strategies found the interventions to be effective in reducing diagnostic errors. Conclusion: Despite numerous studies on interventions targeting diagnostic errors, our analyses revealed limited evidence on interventions being practically used in clinical settings and a bias of studies originating from the US (n = 19, 73\% of included studies). There is some evidence that trigger algorithms, including computer based and alert systems, may reduce delayed diagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy. In trauma settings, strategies such as additional patient review (e.g. trauma teams) reduced missed diagnosis and in radiology departments review strategies such as team meetings and error documentation may reduce diagnostic error rates over time. Trial registration: The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database under registration number CRD42017067056.},

Certain recurring curriculum problems have emerged and have been described as "diseases of the curriculum." To be exact, this article includes nine such entities. In addition to the naming of these nine curriculum conditions, there is ample illustrative material to ensure that each curriculum disease is fully explained--although the basic sciences supporting the study of education as a discipline are not advanced enough to allow fuller understanding of the disease processes. There is speculation, however, that even being able to name and describe these disturbances of normal curriculum development might be of help in solving some of our more serious curriculum problems.},

  abstract = {Problem Residency clinician-educator tracks have been created; however, they have generally been limited to a single discipline or program and experienced some challenges. The Graduate Medical Education Scholars Track (GMEST), an embedded longitudinal, multimodal, multidisciplinary clinician-educator track for residents, was piloted at the Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, in academic year 2014-2015. Approach The GMEST is a two-year experience completed during residency training. The goal is to prepare trainees for academic careers as clinician-educators with a focus on medical education scholarship. This track is designed for residents from diverse training programs with variable clinical schedules and blends a live interactive program, asynchronous instruction and discussion, and overarching multimodal mentorship in medical education. Participants are expected to complete a capstone medical education project and submit it to institutional, regional, and/or national venues. Outcomes Data gathered from the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 cohorts demonstrated that 21/22 (95\%) participants were satisfied with the GMEST curriculum, felt it was important to their development as future clinician-educators, and felt it would positively influence their ability to work in medical education. Further, 18/22 (82\%) participants wished to pursue a career as a clinician-educator and in medical education leadership and/or scholarship. Next Steps The authors will longitudinally track graduates' future career positions, projects, publications, and awards, and cross-match and compare GMEST graduates with non-GMEST residents interested in medical education. Faculty mentors, program directors, and the Medical Education, Research, Innovation, Teaching, and Scholarship community will be asked for feedback on the GMEST.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Various factors including the system of examination affect  students' academic achievement. Annual or semester-based examinations are commonly observed practices. Students like semester system, as their academic performance is significantly higher in this system. Medical education in Pakistan has largely followed the British system of preclinical and clinical years of teaching followed by end-of-year examinations. In the wake of medical education reform, the semester system of examination having objective assessment was recently introduced in medical institutes of Pakistan. There is no empirical evidence regarding the effects of this change on medical students' academic achievement. This study aimed to assess whether the semester system has made any difference in the academic performance of medical students as compared to the annual system of examination. METHOD: Anatomy percentage scores of two batches of students who sequentially took annual and semester examinations were collected from a medical university.~The data were analyzed for normality and later descriptive and inferential statistical tests were carried. RESULTS: The data of 748 students (semester = 319 and annual = 429) were entered for analysis. The students who took semester-based examination (N = 319, M = 72.30, SD = 8.25) performed better than the students who took annual examination (N = 429, M = 64.36, SD = 10.69). The difference in mean percentage scores was statistically significant (t-test = 11.04, degrees of freedom (df) = 746; p {$<$} 0.01; 95\% CI, 6.53-9.35). DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated the enhanced scores of students who sat the semester examination. The findings of this research supported the earlier studies that suggested the restructuring of course durations and examination system have enhanced students' achievement. Also, the objective assessments method showed improved academic performance. CONCLUSION: The study found that anatomy knowledge assessment scores of students who sat semester examination were significantly higher than students who sat the end-of-year examination. Further studies are needed to understand if this difference is also observed in other basic sciences subjects and continues in the performance clinical years.},

  abstract = {Aim: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an active teaching methodology, recently implemented also in the field of nursing education. The main objective of this study was to identify, appraise and summarize primary studies on the effectiveness of TBL in achieving learning outcomes in undergraduate nursing students. The secondary objective was to explore the generic competencies the students developed, and their reactions and attitudes. Study design: A systematic review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Databases sources: Cochrane Library, Pubmed/Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Eric; Google Scholar was used to search for grey literature and the reference lists of the retrieved papers. Review methods: A research protocol was developed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines. Two reviewers conducted the selection process. The “JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist” was used to check the quality of the selected studies. Results: We included 12 studies: 2 monocentric randomized controlled trials and 10 quasi-experimental studies. Nine out of 12 studies produced significant results in favour of TBL in terms of academic performance and skills development, however results were divergent when TBL was compared with other teaching methods. The results of 7 studies highlighted the effectiveness of TBL in improving the development of communication skills, interprofessional learning, and self-directed learning. Divergent results were obtained with regard to problem solving and critical thinking skills. TBL promoted classroom engagement, however it did not seem to be associated with better learning outcomes. Conclusions: Overall, TBL was found to be effective in achieving undergraduate nursing students' learning outcomes, but evidence was not sufficiently strong to warrant that it is more effective than other teaching methods. The results of this review are in favour of the implementation of TBL in nursing education, however studies with more rigorous methods and with a mixed method design are required to improve the transferability of results.},

  abstract = {Background Students differ in their preferred methods of acquiring, processing, and recalling new information. The aim of this study was to investigate the learning style preferences of undergraduate dental students and examine the influence of gender, Grade Point Average (GPA), and academic year levels on these preferences. Methods The Arabic version of the visual, aural, read/write, and kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire was administered to 491 students from the first- to the fifth-year academic classes at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the learning styles of the students, and Chi-square test and Fisher's test were used to compare the learning preferences between genders and among academic years. Significance was set at a p-value of {$<$}0.05. Results A total of 368 dental students completed the questionnaire. The multimodal learning style was preferred by 63.04\% of the respondents, with the remaining 36\% having a unimodal style preference. The aural (A) and the kinesthetic (K) styles were the most preferred unimodal styles. The most common style overall was the quadmodal (VARK) style with 23.64\% having this preference. These differences did not reach statistical significance (p{$>$}0.05). Females were more likely to prefer a bimodal learning style over a unimodal style (relative risk =2.37). Students with a GPA of "C" were less likely to have a bimodal or a quadmodal style preference compared to students with a GPA of "A" (relative risk =0.34 and 0.36, respectively). Second-year students were less likely to prefer a bimodal over a unimodal style compared to first-year students (relative risk =0.34). Conclusion The quadmodal VARK style is the preferred learning method chosen by dental students, followed by unimodal aural and kinesthetic styles. Gender was found to influence learning style preferences. Students with a "C" GPA tend to prefer unimodal learning style preferences. The VARK questionnaire is a relatively quick and simple tool to reveal the learning style preferences on an individual or a group level. Dental educators should adjust their delivery methods to approximate the learning preferences of their students. Dental students are encouraged to adapt a multimodal style of learning to improve their academic results.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Stress among medical students induced by academic pressures is on the rise among the student population in Pakistan and other parts of the world. Our study examined the relationship between two different systems employed to assess academic performance and the levels of stress among students at two different medical schools in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A sample consisting of 387 medical students enrolled in pre-clinical years was taken from two universities, one employing the semester examination system with grade point average (GPA) scores (a tiered system) and the other employing an annual examination system with only pass/fail grading. A pre-designed, self-administered questionnaire was distributed. Test anxiety levels were assessed by The Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS). Overall stress was evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: There were 82 males and 301 females while four did not respond to the gender question. The mean age of the entire cohort was 19.791.0 years. A total of 98 participants were from the pass/fail assessment system while 289 were from the GPA system. There was a higher proportion of females in the GPA system (85\% vs. 59\%; pB0.01). Students in the pass/fail assessment system had a lower score on the WTAS (2.490.8 vs. 2.890.7; p0.01) and the PSS (17.096.7 vs. 20.396.8; pB0.01), indicating lower levels of test anxiety and overall stress than in students enrolled in the GPA assessment system. More students in the pass/fail system were satisfied with their performance than those in the GPA system. Conclusion: Based on the present study, we suggest governing bodies to revise and employ a uniform assessment system for all the medical colleges to improve student academic performance and at the same time reduce stress levels. Our results indicate that the pass/fail assessment system accomplishes these objectives.},

Subjects: Used a purposive sample of 92 nursing students who were enrolled in maternity nursing course. Main Outcome measures: Measure the difference in learning styles of nursing students after introducing an intervention of PBL as a teaching methodology. Results: The dominant learning preference of the students was the read/write preference followed by the kinesthetic, still most of the students represented a multimodal learning preference. No significant difference was found between males and females. A significant difference in the learning preferences of the students in the pre-post test was found. In the pretest the mean of the total VARK score 13.9 (SD = 2) where as in the post test the mean of the total VARK score = 16.5 (SD = 3.5). In the pre-test 54\% of students had a multimodal preference whereas 68\% of students have a multimodal preference post-test. Conclusions: Most students are able to learn effectively as long as the instructor provides different learning activities in the areas assessed in VARK. Active learning might be enhanced in large classrooms by presenting models and demonstrations, discussions, debates, answering questions, and role playing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 600 medical students at King Saud University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2012 to July 2013. The Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic questionnaire (VARK) questionnaire was used to categorize learning style preferences. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used to identify the learning style preferences of medical students and their relationship to academic achievement, gender, marital status, residency, different teaching curricula, and study resources (for example, teachers' PowerPoint slides, textbooks, and journals). Results: The results indicated that 261 students (43\%) preferred to learn using all VARK modalities. There was a significant difference in learning style preferences between genders (p=0.028). The relationship between learning style preferences and students in different teaching curricula was also statistically significant (p=0.047). However, learning style preferences are not related to a student's academic achievements, marital status, residency, or study resources (for example, teachers' PowerPoint slides, textbooks, and journals). Also, after being adjusted to other studies' variables, the learning style preferences were not related to GPA. Conclusion: Our findings can be used to improve the quality of teaching in Saudi Arabia; students would be advantaged if teachers understood the factors that can be related to students' learning styles.},

  abstract = {Context               Time pressure has been implicated in the suboptimal diagnostic performance of doctors and in increases in diagnostic errors. However, the reasons underlying these effects are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of time pressure on physicians’ diagnostic accuracy and to explore the mediating effects of perceived stress (emotional pathway) and number of plausible diagnostic hypotheses (cognitive pathway) on the proposed relationship.                                         Methods                                We conducted a randomised controlled experiment. A total of 75 senior internal medicine residents completed eight written clinical cases under conditions with (                 n                 = 40) or without (                 n                 = 35) time pressure. They were then asked to: (i) rate the overall stress experienced, and (ii) write down any alternative hypotheses they had thought of when diagnosing the cases. In a post hoc analysis, a mediation path analysis was performed to test the causal relationships between time pressure, perceived stress and number of alternative diagnoses.                                                        Results               Participants who were under time pressure spent less time diagnosing the cases (85.54 seconds versus 181.81 seconds; p{$<$} 0.001) and had a lower mean diagnostic accuracy score (0.44 versus 0.53; p = 0.01). In addition, they reported more stress (5.80 versus 4.69; p = 0.01) and generated fewer plausible tentative hypotheses (0.37 versus 0.51; p = 0.01). Two path coefficients were found to be statistically significant; the first path coefficient referred to the relationship between time pressure and perceived stress (standardised β = 0.25, p = 0.029), and the second negative path coefficient referred to the relationship between time pressure and number of plausible alternative hypotheses (standardised β = −0.32, p{$<$} 0.01).                                         Conclusions               Time pressure adversely influences physicians’ diagnostic accuracy by increasing their stress response and reducing the number of plausible hypotheses as mediators.                        ,              Time pressure reduces accuracy. While that is clear, al Qahtani et~al. demonstrate that this occurs through both stress responses and a reduction in the number of hypotheses considered plausible},

  abstract = {Introduction: Research findings in medical education support the importance of positive role models in enhancing learning and influencing the career path of medical students and graduates. The authors explored the characteristics of positive and negative role models during Community-Based Education and Service (COBES), as well as their effect on trainees’ career paths. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire among medical students to explore the characteristics of positive and negative role models during COBES. Associations between gender, choice of specialty, and practice location were assessed using the chi-square test. All qualitative data analysis was performed using the principles of primary, secondary, and tertiary coding. Result: The majority of the students indicated that role modeling during COBES will affect their choice of specialty and practice location with a significant gender difference in terms of practice location (p {$<$} 0.005). Qualitative data supported the finding that positive role modeling during COBES may influence graduates willingness to work in rural area. Conclusion: The desire and willingness to work in a rural community combined with good communication and excellent interpersonal skills as well as good leadership skills are attributes of good role modeling that could influence medical students’ career choice during COBES.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Workplace-based assessment (WBA) serves a critical role in supporting competency-based medical education (CBME) by providing assessment data to inform competency decisions and support learning. Many WBA systems have been developed, but little is known about how to effectively implement WBA. Filling this gap is important for creating suitable and beneficial assessment processes that support large-scale use of CBME. As a step toward filling this gap, the authors describe what is known about WBA implementation and use to identify knowledge gaps and future directions. METHOD: The authors used Arksey and O'Malley's 6-stage scoping review framework to conduct the review, including: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and (6) consulting with relevant stakeholders. RESULTS: In 2019-2020, the authors searched and screened 726 papers for eligibility using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. One hundred sixty-three met inclusion criteria. The authors identified 5 themes in their analysis: (1) Many WBA tools and programs have been implemented, and barriers are common across fields and specialties; (2) Theoretical perspectives emphasize the need for data-driven implementation strategies; (3) User perceptions of WBA vary and are often dependent on implementation factors; (4) Technology solutions could provide useful tools to support WBA; and (5) Many areas of future research and innovation remain. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of WBA as an implemented practice to support CBME remains constrained. To remove these constraints, future research should aim to generate generalizable knowledge on WBA implementation and use, address implementation factors, and investigate remaining knowledge gaps.},

Method The authors merged the 2015 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) National MD-PhD Program Outcomes Survey database with selected data from the AAMC Student Records System, Graduation Questionnaire, and Graduate Medical Education (GME) Track Resident Survey. At the person level, they tested variables of interest for independent associations with MD-PhD graduates' research engagement using chi-square, Pearson correlations, and analysis of variance tests and logistic and linear regressions. Results Of 3,297 MD-PhD graduates from 1991-2010 who were no longer in GME training in 2015, 78.0\% (2,572/3,297) reported research engagement. In models controlling for several variables, a neurology (vs internal medicine; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.48; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60-3.86) or pathology (vs internal medicine; AOR: 1.89; 95\% CI: 1.33-2.68) specialty, full-time faculty/research scientist career intention at graduation (vs all other career intentions; AOR: 3.04; 95\% CI: 2.16-4.28), and ≥ 1 year of GME research (vs no GME research year[s]; AOR: 2.45; 95\% CI: 1.96-3.06) predicted a greater likelihood of research engagement. Among graduates engaged in research, the mean percentage of research time was 49.9\% (standard deviation 30.1\%). Participation in ≥ 1 year of GME research (beta [β] coefficient: 7.99, P {$<$}.001) predicted a higher percentage of research time, whereas a radiation oncology (β: -28.70), diagnostic radiology (β: -32.92), or surgery (β: -29.61) specialty, among others, predicted a lower percentage of research time (each P {$<$}.001 vs internal medicine). Conclusions Most MD-PhD graduates were engaged in research, but the extent of their engagement varied substantially among specialties. Across specialties, participation in research during GME may be one factor that sustains MD-PhD graduates' subsequent early- to midcareer research engagement.},

It is important that medical students are afforded the best medical education possible to prepare them for residency placement. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of P/F grading in medical school on residency placement. Methods: This study compared archival residency match data from two medical school classes. The Class of 2016 had tiered grading and the Class of 2017 had P/F grading in the first year of medical school. Doximity’s Residency Navigator was used to rank the residency programs and an independent samples t-test was calculated to determine if residency rankings differed by class. Results: The findings showed no statistically significant differences in residency placement when comparing a cohort of medical school graduates with tiered grading to a cohort with P/F grading in the first year of medical school. Conclusion: These findings may be useful to medical education leaders when making decisions about grading systems. Medical education leaders should consider implementing P/F grading into the first year of medical school.},

The article begins with an overview of common views and misconceptions about student ratings, followed by clarification of what student ratings are and are not. Next are two sections that provide advice for two audiences—administrators and faculty evaluators—to help them accurately, responsibly, and appropriately use and interpret student ratings data. A list of administrator questions is followed by a list of advice for faculty responsible for evaluating other faculty members’ records.},

The purpose of this paper is to report on the results of focus groups to evaluate the use of ARS-facilitated case activities in two graduate health professions courses. TEACHING METHOD: ARS, in conjunction with case scenarios, were used in Master's of Health Administration (MHA) and Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) courses. In the MHA course, the scenarios related to problem-solving and ethics, taught earlier. In the DPT course, scenarios related to treating patients with hip, knee, and foot pain. Students used ARS to respond to decisions regarding the scenarios. ASSESSMENT: Students' perceptions of activities were evaluated using focus groups. CONCLUSION: ARS-enhanced case activities were valuable for applying and reinforcing course concepts, allowing anonymity, and allowing peer comparison to gauge individual progress of course concepts. At the same time, nuances to benefits per student group were revealed.},

Using the proposed method, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, caffeine, theophylline, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in ten instant coffee samples were analyzed. These analytes except for theophylline were detected in all samples. An increase in the caffeine content in instant coffee samples tended to decrease in both trigonelline and chlorogenic acid contents, and the trigonelline content was found to be correlated well with the chlorogenic acid content (R 2 = 0.887). 2015},

High-throughput metabolomics screening can provide vital insight into the pathophysiological pathways of DM and help in managing its effects. The primary aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding and management of DM by providing reliable evidence of the relationships between metabolites and type 1 diabetes (T1D) and metabolites and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Information for the study was obtained from the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, and leads to additional articles that were obtained from the reference lists of the studies examined. The results from the selected studies were used to assess the relationships between diabetes (T1D and/or T2D) and metabolite markers-such as glutamine, glycine, and aromatic amino acids-in patients. Seventy studies were selected from the three databases and from the reference lists in the records retrieved. All studies explored associations between various metabolites and T1D or T2D. This review identified several plasma metabolites associated with T2D prediabetes and/or T1D and/or T2D in humans. The evidence shows that metabolites such as glucose, fructose, amino acids, and lipids are typically altered in individuals with T1D and T2D. These metabolites exhibit significant predictive associations with T2D prediabetes, T1D, and/or T2D. The current review suggests that changes in plasma metabolites can be identified by metabolomic techniques and used to identify and analyze T1D and T2D biomarkers. The results of the metabolomic studies can be used to help create effective interventions for managing these diseases.},

Although the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)/non-STEMI paradigm is well-established, with “STEMI” representing ACO, its evidence base is poor, and this can have dire consequences. The universally recommended STEMI criteria do not accurately diagnose ACO; in fact, they miss more than one-fourth of the patients with ACO, and also result in a substantial burden of unnecessary catheterization laboratory activations.

  abstract = {Given the focus on boosting retention rates and the potential benefits of proactive and early identification of students who may require support, higher education institutions are looking at the data already captured in university systems. Student early alert systems are part of formal, proactive, early intervention communication initiatives that institutions have put into place to help with the timely identification and intervention (alert) of at-risk students. The significance of student early alert systems is that support could be offered to high-risk students while they are still enrolled in the unit and able to influence their success/failure before the unit completes. Delivering timely interventions to students via a student early alert system typically requires teaching staff to identify at-risk students, and act upon that information in a way that would encourage students to change their behaviours. However, little is understood regarding teachers’ needs and attitudes towards the use of such a system. In the context of a prototype early alert system, this article reports the practices and opinions of a range of teaching staff across all fac­ ulties within an institution. The article sheds light on how teachers measure student performance and engagement in their units, and the perceived benefits and barriers of using the early alert system to identify and manage at-risk students.},

A descriptive synthesis of important study characteristics and effect estimates for learning outcomes was done. Results: Three controlled trials in 321 participants from the United States were included for review. ARS knowledge retention scores were lower than the control group in one study, higher than control group provided that immediate feedback was given about each question in one study, and equivalent between intervention and control groups in another study.

  abstract = {Introduction: Based on the needs of the health system, continuous revising and monitoring are essential for General Practice (GP) Curriculum. The present study was conducted to investigate the diseases of GP Curriculum based on the students’ and professors’ viewpoints. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2018. A total of 80 GP students of internship and 71 professors of the faculty of medicine in clinical and basic science disciplines were enrolled in the study using quota and convenience sampling methods, respectively. Two self-made, reliable, and validated 4-point scale questionnaires (ranging from totally agree to totally disagree) were used to collect the data on the viewpoints of students and professors on the diseases of GP curriculum. The mean score and percentage of agreement between professors and students on the incidence of each disease were calculated. Results: The highest and lowest rates of agreement between the professors and students in terms of the presence of curriculum diseases belonged to the echolalia curriculum with a mean and standard deviation of 1.92±0.68 and the dean denial with a mean and standard deviation of 2.0±6.68, respectively. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the viewpoints of professors and students regarding the diseases of the carcinoma of the curriculum (P{$<$}0.001), idiopathic colitis (P{$<$}0.001), the schizophrenia of the curriculum (P=0.01), and echolalia curriculum (P=0.01). Conclusion: The present study showed that professors and students were all in agreement about 12 out of 13 diseases of the GP curriculum. Thus, educational planners in Iran’s medical schools should focus on the continuous evaluation and the necessity of curriculum revision, as one of the priorities of the educational system.},

  abstract = {Background: Adherence to a healthy diet has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Identifying nutritional biomarkers of diet quality may be complementary to traditional questionnaire-based methods and may provide insights concerning disease mechanisms and prevention. Objective: To identify metabolites associated with diet quality assessed via the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and its components. Methods: This cross-sectional study used FFQ data and plasma metabolomic profiles, mostly lipid related, from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 1460) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 1051). Linear regression models assessed associations of the AHEI and its components with individual metabolites. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) investigated overlapping patterns between AHEI components and metabolites. Principal component analysis (PCA) and explanatory factor analysis were used to consolidate correlated metabolites into uncorrelated factors. We used stepwise multivariable regression to create a metabolomic score that is an indicator of diet quality. Results: The AHEI was associated with 83 metabolites in the NHS and 96 metabolites in the HPFS after false discovery rate adjustment. Sixty-three of these significant metabolites overlapped between the 2 cohorts. CCA identified "healthy"AHEI components (e.g., nuts, whole grains) and metabolites (n = 27 in the NHS and 33 in the HPFS) and "unhealthy"AHEI components (e.g., red meat, trans fat) and metabolites (n = 56 in the NHS and 63 in the HPFS). PCA-derived factors composed of highly saturated triglycerides, plasmalogens, and acylcarnitines were associated with unhealthy AHEI components while factors composed of highly unsaturated triglycerides were linked to healthy AHEI components. The stepwise regression analysis contributed to a metabolomics score as a predictor of diet quality. Conclusion: We identified metabolites associated with healthy and unhealthy eating behaviors. The observed associations were largely similar between men and women, suggesting that metabolomics can be a complementary approach to self-reported diet in studies of diet and chronic disease.},

Numerous clinician-educator-training programs exist within graduate medical education (GME) as clinician-educator tracks (CETs). However, there is a call for the clinician-educator pipeline to begin earlier. This work aims to identify and characterize clinician-educator track-like programs (CETLs) available in undergraduate medical education (UME). We developed an algorithm of 20 individual keyword queries to search the website of each U.S. allopathic medical school for CETLs. We performed the web search between March to April 2021 and repeated the search between July and September 2021. The search identified CETLs for 79 (51\%) of the 155~U.S. allopathic medical schools. The identified CETLs commonly address the clinician-educator competency of educational theory (86\%, 68/79), are formally organized as concentrations or analogous structures (52\%, 41/79), and span all four years of medical school (37\%, 29/79). The prevalence of CETLs varies with geography and medical school ranking. We provide an overview of the current state of CETLs as assessed from institutional websites. To create a future with a sustainable output of skilled clinician-educators, UME must continue to increase the number and quality of CETLs.},

  abstract = {Concern that many graduate medical students do not know sufficient anatomy to safely and effectively assess and treat patients is a frequent complaint by clinicians. Although downgrading of anatomy relative to newer basic sciences is often blamed, there is evidence students rapidly forget anatomy. However, there are a number of ways instructors can foster long-term retention of anatomy, the most powerful involving intertwining clinical and anatomical information and assessing in-depth processing. Assisting this process is ‘triaging’ the curriculum so it contains only clinically engaged anatomy. Students are far more likely to remember information which they consider to be relevant to their future vocation. Therefore, teaching only anatomy which is likely to be useful in a clinical context tends to improve long-term retention of anatomy by medical students. Other helpful techniques include incorporating surface and radiological anatomy in a vertically integrated curriculum, reciprocal peer teaching and employing clinically qualified instructors.},

These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.},

In this study, the authors compared the results of traditional Angoff and Hofstee standard-setting exercises with the Mastery Angoff and Patient-Safety approaches for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion skills examinations. The authors also evaluated how these standards affected the historical performance of residents who participated in a simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) curriculum for CVC insertion skills. Method In April and May 2015, 12 physicians with expertise in CVC insertion set MPSs for previously published internal jugular (IJ) and subclavian (SC) CVC insertion checklists using Angoff, Hofstee, Mastery Angoff, and Patient-Safety approaches. The resulting MPSs were compared using historical performance of internal medicine and emergency medicine residents who participated in CVC insertion SBML. Results The MPSs were set as follows: Angoff: IJ 91\% checklist items correct, SC 90\%. Hofstee: IJ 88\%, SC 90\%. Mastery Angoff: IJ 98\%, SC 98\%. Patient-Safety: IJ 98\%, SC 98\%. Based on the historical performance of 143 residents assessed on IJ and SC insertion, applying the 98\% MPS would result in additional practice and retesting of 55/123 residents (45\%) who had previously passed the IJ examination and 36/130 residents (28\%) who had passed the SC examination using the Angoff and Hofstee MPSs. Conclusions The Mastery Angoff and Patient-Safety standard-setting approaches resulted in higher CVC insertion SBML MPSs compared with traditional standard-setting methods. Further study should assess the impact of these more rigorous standards on patient outcomes.},

Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) is one potential solution to this problem. This study evaluated the effects of a randomized trial of thoracentesis SBML on patient complications: iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP), hemothorax, and reexpansion pulmonary edema (REPE). Method The authors randomized internal medicine residents to undergo thoracentesis SBML at a tertiary care academic center from December 2012 to May 2016. They subsequently compared thoracentesis complications from procedures performed by SBML-trained residents, traditionally trained residents (no simulation training), and those referred to pulmonary medicine or interventional radiology (IR). Results During the study period, 917 thoracenteses were performed on 709 patients. IP occurred in 60 (6.5\%) procedures, of which 7 (11.6\%) were clinically meaningful. SBML-trained residents performed procedures with a trend toward lower combined clinically meaningful complications (IP, hemothorax, REPE) compared with traditionally trained residents (7.9\% vs. 0\%; P =.06). SBML-trained residents caused fewer clinically meaningful IPs compared with traditionally trained residents, pulmonary, and IR referrals (P =.02). Hemothorax occurred after 4 (0.4\%) thoracenteses, and SBML-trained residents had a trend toward lower hemothorax (0) compared with other groups (P =.07). REPE occurred after 3 (0.3\%) procedures, with no differences between groups. SBML-trained residents performed procedures with lower combined clinically meaningful complications compared with other groups (P =.008). Conclusions Residents randomized to an SBML intervention performed thoracenteses with low rates of clinically meaningful complications. Rigorous education represents a successful quality improvement strategy.},

This work intended to analyze the impact of interactive teaching on medical students’ engagement, learning, performance, understanding and attendance in virtual classes of physiology, pathology, and pharmacology during COVID-19 pandemic.                                         Methods               A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at college of medicine at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Riyadh during January-April 2022. Third- and fourth-year medical students filled a self-reported questionnaire that assessed students’ engagement, understanding, performance, and attendance during the sessions of three courses within the curriculum. The Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the difference between the survey responses.                                         Results               A total of 184/234 questionnaires were completed and returned, with an overall response rate of 78.6\%. Fifty-five percent of the participants were involved at least more than 5 times in polls during the class. Majority (86.9\%), of the students agreed on enjoying participation in polls during the class, and 88.9\% recommended the utilization of the polls again. Participation in polls improved understanding and performance of 88\%, and 63\% of students respectively. In addition, 38\% were neutral regarding attendance improvement and spending more time for the class. Around 53\% students agreed that polls improved their grades.                                         Conclusion               In conclusion, this study showed that there is an impact of using interactive polls in virtual classes in medical students at KSAU-HS. It is recommended to continue using polls in all subjects in on-site sessions. This will be a great preface step toward switching the traditional teaching to the interactive teaching using flipped classroom strategy in the future.},

  abstract = {Background: A game-based virtual reality phone application is used as a simulation to teach psychomotor skills in nursing education. Objective: This study aims at determining the effect of a game-based virtual reality phone application on tracheostomy care education for nursing students. Design: Single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted from March–April 2017. Setting: Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Central Anatolia of Turkey. Participants: A total of 86 first-year nursing students registered in Fundamentals of Nursing-II were included in this study. The students were divided at random into two groups, control (n = 43)and experimental (n = 43). Method: The data were collected with an informative features form, a tracheostomy care knowledge test and skill checklists, and a performance assessment form. The control group commenced the study first so that the students did not affect each other. After the students completed the theoretical class, laboratory class, and small group study, they had their knowledge test and skills evaluation. The application featured tracheostomy care and was designed in support of formal education. It was uploaded to the mobile phones of the experimental group at a different phase of the study from the control group. After the experimental group made use of this application for seven days, their last knowledge test and skills evaluation were conducted. Results: The results of this study determined that the suctioning a tracheostomy tube and peristomal skin care average final test scores of the students in the experiment group were higher than the average scores of the students in the control group; this was statistically significant (p = 0.017, p = 0.003). Conclusion: The game-based virtual reality phone application was effective in teaching the skill of suctioning a tracheostomy tube for nursing students in the short term, and it is recommended that this application be used in psychomotor skill training.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Men have more kidney stones compared with women; however, the difference is progressively decreasing. The reasons for higher prevalence of stones in men, as well as increasing prevalence in women, is a subject of ongoing speculation. In this review, we summarize the evidence of differences between men and women and expand on the speculative causes. RECENT FINDINGS Stone incidence is rising in women and adolescent girls. Stone disease is more heritable among men than women, and women demonstrate greater influence of the unique environment. Women under the age of 50 years who have been pregnant, have more than double the odds of kidney stones compared with those who have never been pregnant. Women are more burdened with obesity, bariatric surgery and dieting, all associated with increased stones. Women have higher urinary pH because of greater absorption of dietary organic anions leading to increased urinary citrate, compared with men, and they differ in tubular calcium handling. SUMMARY It is obvious that the cause of stones in men and women is complex and requires further study. Potential clues offered are in the change of the female environment, influencing increasing incidence in stones, particularly of younger women and female adolescents.},

  abstract = {Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) have become ubiquitous as a form of assessment in medical education but involve substantial resource demands and considerable local variation.A detailed understanding of the processes by which OSCEs are designed and administered could improve feasibility and sustainability. This exploration of OSCE design is informed by Practice Theory, which suggests assessment design processes are dynamic, social and situated activities. The overall purpose is to provide insights that inform on-the-ground OSCE administration. Fifteen interviews were conducted with OSCE academics and administrators from three medical schools in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. Drawing from post-qualitative inquiry, Schatzki’s Practice Theory was used both as a sensibility and as an analytic framework. OSCE design was characterised by planning activities, administration activities, negotiation activities and bureaucratic activities; it involves significant and resource-intensive effort in negotiation and coordination. There was considerable local variation but at the same time activities were remarkably consonant across national boundaries. There was a tension between general understandings such as reliability and validity that underpin the OSCE and the improvisational practices associated with design and administration. Our findings highlighted the role of blueprints as a key coordinating artefact but with too many rules and procedures prompting cycles of bureaucracy and complexity. Emphasising coordination rather than standardisation might ease workloads, support adaptation to local environments and prevent an overly reductive approach to this assessment format.},

Whilst student comments provide valuable insights into their experiences, there is limited published research reporting the extent to which student comments are offensive and professional. The aim of this study was to investigate the number of student comments that were identified as being offensive or unprofessional in an online unit evaluation survey collected in a semester in 2010 from an Australian university. One person read 30,684 comments taken from 17,855 surveys and identified comments considered to be abusive or unprofessional. Comments were categorised as either abusive or unprofessional and by the intended target (that is, teacher, unit, resource). Thirteen abusive comments (0.04 \% of the sample) were identified. Five abusive comments were directed at the teacher and eight were targeted at teaching and learning experiences. Forty-six comments (0.15 \% of the sample) were identified as unprofessional. Of these, seven comments were directed at the teacher and 34 were about units. This suggests that the vast majority of students do not abuse the privilege of giving anonymous feedback. Strategies identified in this paper to educate students and give appropriate feedback can be adopted by universities to minimise offensive comments. Universities can educate students and teachers in appropriate and professional ways of working together, in providing professional feedback to improve the student experience in teaching and learning and to support and mentor teachers in their academic careers.},

The response is from a K-12 educational environment perspective. Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s typology of different ethical approaches to learning analytics adds value to the special issue topic of shifting to digital as it provides different ways to view learning analytics as well as the type of approval(s) possibly needed for each view. K-12 educational institutions can utilize the manuscript as a starting place for review of their ethical oversights when analyzing student data as more schools are shifting to digital. A limitation of Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s manuscript in supporting the shift to digital is that the manuscript was published before the overwhelming shift to digital was mandated as a result of Covid-19. Future work related to the manuscript and with a focus on the K-12 educational environment could include K-12 education agencies deriving a K-12 specific typology from a review of ethical oversight protocols or analyzing the effects of the shift to digital in K-12 on the original typology.},

Methods: A non-inferior parallel group randomized controlled trial. The study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in August and September 2019. All students participated in a 15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and interactive VR application using hand controllers with some haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge, ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary outcome was the number of students who documented all the eight predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the correct order in a practical test on an advanced simulator manikin with a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit was 13\% points. Results: Of all eligible students, 84\% participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n = 149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8\% in individual VR doing all observations in correct order compared to 27.1\% TP (absolute difference 2.3\% points, one sided 95\% CI 2.3 to 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between the groups, but more students in VR reported liking the way they practiced (absolute difference 46\% points, 95\% CI 36.5 to 56.6) and that it was a good way to learn (36.9\% points, 95\% CI 26.8 to 47). VR also scored high on the System Usability Scale (mean difference 6.4\% points, 95\% CI 2.8-10.1). Conclusions: Individual self-practicing the ABCDE approach in VR was non-inferior to individual self-practicing with traditional equipment.},

Method Three databases (MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC) were searched for articles published from 1980 through September 7, 2017. English-language articles were included if they (1) described an educational intervention addressing professionalism, (2) included postgraduate medical trainees, and (3) evaluated professionalism outcomes. Results Of 3,383 articles identified, 50 were included in the review. The majority evaluated pre-and posttests for a single group (24, 48\%). Three (6\%) were randomized controlled trials. The most common teaching modality was small-group discussions (28, 56\%); other methods included didactics, reflection, and simulations. Half (25, 50\%) used multiple modalities. The professionalism topics most commonly addressed were professional values/behavior (42, 84\%) and physician well-being (23, 46\%). Most studies measured self-reported outcomes (attitude and behavior change) (27, 54\%). Eight (16\%) evaluated observed behavior and 3 (6\%) evaluated patient outcomes. Of 35 studies that evaluated statistical significance, 20 (57\%) reported statistically significant positive effects. Interventions targeting improvements in knowledge were most often effective (8/12, 67\%). Curriculum duration was not associated with effectiveness. The 45 quantitative studies were of moderate quality (Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument mean score = 10.3). Conclusions Many published curricula addressing professionalism in PGME are effective. Significant heterogeneity in curricular design and outcomes assessed made it difficult to synthesize results to identify best practices.

Data are needed to characterize these infections and define correlates of breakthrough and infectivity. METHODS At the largest medical center in Israel, we identified breakthrough infections by performing extensive evaluations of health care workers who were symptomatic (including mild symptoms) or had known infection exposure. These evaluations included epidemiologic investigations, repeat reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT), serologic assays, and genomic sequencing. Correlates of breakthrough infection were assessed in a case-control analysis. We matched patients with breakthrough infection who had antibody titers obtained within a week before SARS-CoV-2 detection (peri-infection period) with four to five uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict the geometric mean titers among cases and controls and the ratio between the titers in the two groups. We also assessed the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and N gene cycle threshold (Ct) values with respect to infectivity. RESULTS Among 1497 fully vaccinated health care workers for whom RT-PCR data were available, 39 SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were documented. Neutralizing antibody titers in case patients during the peri-infection period were lower than those in matched uninfected controls (case-to-control ratio, 0.361; 95\% confidence interval, 0.165 to 0.787). Higher peri-infection neutralizing antibody titers were associated with lower infectivity (higher Ct values). Most breakthrough cases were mild or asymptomatic, although 19\% had persistent symptoms ({$>$}6 weeks). The B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant was found in 85\% of samples tested. A total of 74\% of case patients had a high viral load (Ct value, {$<$}30) at some point during their infection; however, of these patients, only 17 (59\%) had a positive result on concurrent Ag-RDT. No secondary infections were documented. CONCLUSIONS Among fully vaccinated health care workers, the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period. Most breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic, although persistent symptoms did occur.},

  abstract = {Background: Objectively structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are a stressful experience for many health care students and professionals in training. Mock OSCEs have been shown to be beneficial for student OSCE preparation. However, due to their expense and administrative burden students may only get a few opportunities to partake in these. To address this gap in student preparation a series of regularly run totally peer led multi-role practice OSCEs (PrOSCEs) was developed. Methods: Fifteen PrOSCEs were run over five-months. A total of 32 second year medical students took part, all of whom were enrolled on the graduate-entry programme at the University of Southampton. In each PrOSCE, 18 participants rotated through the roles of 'student', 'examiner' and 'patient' in six simulated stations designed by their peers. Peer feedback was provided after each station. At the end of the series of PrOSCEs students were asked to fill in an anonymous online feedback survey to assess the usefulness of the PrOSCEs in exam preparation. Results: Twenty-two students responded to the survey. 100\% of respondents deemed routine participation either 'very useful' or 'useful' in preparing for their exam. PrOSCEs were found to improve confidence (mean = 7.9/10, 95\% CI 7.4-8.3), expected performance (mean = 7.5/10, 95\% CI 6.8-8.2) and help guide revision (mean = 8.3/10, 95\% CI 7.6-9.0). Self-perceived teaching performance and confidence in providing feedback was also positively associated with participation. The most beneficial roles were 'student' and 'station creator'. Free-text feedback suggests that the informal setting and regular practice were particularly beneficial. Conclusion: The peer-led nature of the PrOSCEs allows for a low cost, low administrative burden and easy to replicate adjunct or alternative to large scale mock OSCEs. In addition the multi-role aspect of this approach could enhance exam preparation and may also improve aptitude as a clinical teacher. Further studies are required to understand if repeated practice has beneficial implications on OSCE performance.},

AIM Our aim was to determine the impact of awareness of LS among medical undergraduates and motivating students to use mixed methods of learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS Before awareness lecture, LS preferences were determined using Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire. Awareness of LS was assessed using a validated questionnaire. Through a lecture, students were oriented to various LSs, impact of LS on their performance, and benefit of using mixed method approach for learning. Subsequently, group discussions were organized. After 3 months, VARK preferences and awareness of LSs were reassessed. Student narratives were collected. Qualitative analysis of the data was done. RESULTS There was a significant increase in the number of students who were aware of LS. The number of participants showing a change in VARK scores for various modalities of learning was also significant (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION Thus, awareness of LSs motivated students to adapt other learning strategies and use mixed methods for learning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consumption of caffeinated beverages such as coffee and tea has been  associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Paradoxically, short-term metabolic studies have shown that caffeine impairs postprandial glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively examine the association of caffeinated compared with caffeine-free beverages, including coffee, tea, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and carbonated artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), with T2D risk. DESIGN: We prospectively observed 74,749 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1984-2008) and 39,059 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS, 1986-2008) who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer at baseline. RESULTS: We documented 7370 incident cases of T2D during 24 y of follow-up in the NHS and 2865 new cases during 22 y of follow-up in the HPFS. After major lifestyle and dietary risk factors were controlled for, caffeinated and caffeine-free SSB intake was significantly associated with a higher risk of T2D in the NHS (RR per serving: 13\% for caffeinated SSBs, 11\% for caffeine-free SSBs; P {$<$} 0.05) and in the HPFS (RR per serving: 16\% for caffeinated SSBs, 23\% for caffeine-free SSBs; P {$<$} 0.01). Only caffeine-free ASB intake in NHS participants was associated with a higher risk of T2D (RR: 6\% per serving; P {$<$} 0.001). Conversely, the consumption of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a lower risk of T2D [RR per serving: 8\% for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee in the NHS (P {$<$} 0.0001) and 4\% for caffeinated and 7\% for decaffeinated coffee in the HPFS (P {$<$} 0.01)]. Only caffeinated tea was associated with a lower T2D risk among NHS participants (RR per serving: 5\%; P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the caffeine content, SSB intake was associated with a higher risk of T2D, and coffee intake was associated with a lower risk of T2D.},

Method In 2015-2016, the authors searched the Ovid MEDLINE, ERIC, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Web of Science, and Scopus databases and seven medical education journals (via OvidSP) for articles published January 1980-December 2015. Two reviewers screened articles for eligibility with inclusion criteria. All authors extracted key data and analyzed data descriptively. Results The authors included 650 articles in the review. More than half (n = 341) were published during 2010-2015. Many centered on medical students (n = 274) or residents (n = 192); some included learners from other disciplines (n = 57). Most (n = 633) described methods used for giving feedback; some (n = 95) described opinions and recommendations regarding feedback. Few studies assessed approaches to feedback with randomized, educational trials (n = 49) or described changes in learner behavior after feedback (n = 49). Even fewer assessed the impact of feedback on patient outcomes (n = 28). Conclusions Feedback is considered an important means of improving learner performance, as evidenced by the number of articles outlining recommendations for feedback approaches. The literature on feedback for learners in medical education is broad, fairly recent, and generally describes new or altered curricular approaches that involve feedback for learners. High-quality, evidence-based recommendations for feedback are lacking. In addition to highlighting calls to reassess the concepts and complex nature of feedback interactions, the authors identify several areas that require further investigation.},

Despite strong and consistent evidence that testing improves retention and recall of information, and superior organization of information within memory, testing continues to be under-utilized as a pedagogical strategy by teachers and as a self-regulatory strategy by learners. Testing that promotes recall rather than recognition of information, that is repeated at intervals over time, and that is accompanied by feedback is optimal for promoting learning. In addition to using testing as a powerful teaching tool, educators should promote the use of self-testing by learners to support the life-long learning that is essential to professional practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Most students admitted to medical school are abstract-passive learners. However, as they progress through the program, active learning and concrete interpersonal interactions become crucial for the acquisition of professional competencies. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how medical students' learning styles change during the course of their undergraduate program. METHODS All students admitted to the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) medical school between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1,290) took the Kolb's Learning Style Inventory at school entrance. Two years later 627 students took it again, and in the seventh and last year of the program 104 students took it for a third time. The distribution of styles at years 1, 3 and 7, and the mobility of students between styles were analyzed with Bayesian models. RESULTS Most freshmen (54\%) were classified as assimilators (abstract-passive learners); convergers (abstract-active) followed with 26\%, whereas divergers (concrete-passive) and accommodators (concrete-active) accounted for 11\% and 9\%, respectively. By year 3, the styles' distribution remained unchanged but in year 7 convergers outnumbered assimilators (49\% vs. 33\%). In general, there were no gender-related differences. DISCUSSION Medical students change their preferred way of learning: they evolve from an abstract-reflexive style to an abstract-active one. This change might represent an adaptation to the curriculum, which evolves from a lecture-based teacher-centered to a problem-based student-centered model.},

Method: For both the graded and pass/fail classes, objective data were collected on academic performance in the first- and second-year courses, the clerkships, United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Steps 1 and 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK), and residency placement. Self-report data were collected using a Web survey (which included the Dupuy General Well-Being Schedule) administered each of the first four semesters of medical school. The study was conducted from 2002 to 2007 at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Results: The pass/fail class exhibited a significant increase in well-being during each of the first three semesters of medical school relative to the graded class, greater satisfaction with the quality of their medical education during the first four semesters of medical school, and greater satisfaction with their personal lives during the first three semesters of medical school. The graded and pass/fail classes showed no significant differences in performance in first- and second-year courses, grades in clerkships, scores on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2CK, success in residency placement, and attendance at academic activities. Conclusions: A change in grading from letter grades to pass/fail in the first two years of medical school conferred distinct advantages to medical students, in terms of improved psychological well-being and satisfaction, without any reduction in performance in courses or clerkships, USMLE test scores, success in residency placement, or level of attendance.},

  abstract = {Health professions education (HPE) emerged as a specific domain of higher education in the 1960s. The interim decades brought the development of advanced training in health professions education and the implementation of HPE offices at many institutions of healthcare and education across the world. Despite these advancements, organizations considering the establishment of HPE offices, or advanced HPE training programs are still challenged by approving authorities to demonstrate that HPE is a discipline and not simply a branch of higher education. Although other scholars have proposed defined characteristics to guide the recognition of study fields as separate academic disciplines, Krishnan’s framework is easily operationalized and its use has been broadly reported in the management, education, and intelligence studies literature, among others. Krishnan contends that an academic discipline generally presents the following characteristics: (1) an object of study and research that, although particular to the discipline, can be common to others; (2) a body of specialized knowledge, relative to the subject of study and research, typically unique to the discipline; (3) theories and concepts that frame and organize the specialized knowledge of the discipline; (4) specific terminologies or technical language related to the subject of study and research; (5) research methods adapted to the particular demands of the discipline; and (6) an institutional presence demonstrated by teaching at the graduate level of subjects specific to the discipline, and by the existence of academic departments and professional associations. The purpose of this paper is to present arguments in support of the status of HPE as an academic discipline using Krishnan’s framework. It is our hope that these arguments will facilitate the efforts of organizations planning for the establishment of HPE offices or advanced HPE training programs at their institutions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Faculty feedback on trainees is critical to guiding trainee progress in  a competency-based medical education framework. The authors aimed to develop and evaluate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that automatically categorizes narrative feedback into corresponding Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Milestone 2.0 subcompetencies. METHOD: Ten academic anesthesiologists analyzed 5,935 narrative evaluations on anesthesiology trainees at 4 graduate medical education (GME) programs between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2021. Each sentence (n = 25,714) was labeled with the Milestone 2.0 subcompetency that best captured its content or was labeled as demographic or not useful. Interrater agreement was assessed by Fleiss' Kappa. The authors trained an NLP model to predict feedback subcompetencies using data from 3 sites and evaluated its performance at a fourth site. Performance metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive predictive value, sensitivity, F1, and calibration curves. The model was implemented at 1 site in a self-assessment exercise. RESULTS: Fleiss' Kappa for subcompetency agreement was moderate (0.44). Model performance was good for professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, and practice-based learning and improvement (AUC 0.79, 0.79, and 0.75, respectively). Subcompetencies within medical knowledge and patient care ranged from fair to excellent (AUC 0.66-0.84 and 0.63-0.88, respectively). Performance for systems-based practice was poor (AUC 0.59). Performances for demographic and not useful categories were excellent (AUC 0.87 for both). In approximately 1 minute, the model interpreted several hundred evaluations and produced individual trainee reports with organized feedback to guide a self-assessment exercise. The model was built into a web-based application. CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed an NLP model that recognized the feedback language of anesthesiologists across multiple GME programs. The model was operationalized in a self-assessment exercise. It is a powerful tool which rapidly organizes large amounts of narrative feedback.},

  abstract = {Background: In medicine, the patient-centered approach is based on interpersonal skills, including communication, structuring the medical interview, and empathy, which have an impact on health professionals’ interpersonal relationships and the quality of care. Training courses on this issue are therefore being developed in universities. We hypothesized that specific training courses in the physician–patient relationship could improve interpersonal skills among medical students during simulated consultations and the immediate satisfaction of standardized patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled fourth-year medical students who participated in a simulated medical consultation session with standardized patients. The evaluation of interpersonal skills was carried out using the Four Habits Coding Scheme, producing a synthetic score out of 115 points used as the primary endpoint. Some students benefited from the training courses offered by the university or by other organizations, mainly based on communication, active listening, or patient-centered approach. A comparison was made with students from the same graduating class who had not received any training. Results: The analysis of the primary endpoint showed a difference of 5 points between the group of students who had attended at least one training course and those who did not (p = 0.001). This difference was even more marked when the students had completed several training courses, up to 14 points higher with three training courses (p = 0.001), each with positive results in different areas of the care relationship. Conclusions: Physician–patient relationship training currently provided in initial education appears to be effective in improving interpersonal skills. A repetition of this training is necessary to increase its impact.},

  abstract = {Background: Diagnostic errors occur frequently in daily clinical practice and put patients' safety at risk. There is an urgent need to improve education on clinical reasoning to reduce diagnostic errors. However, little is known about diagnostic errors of medical students. In this study, the nature of the causes of diagnostic errors made by medical students was analyzed. Methods: In June 2016, 88 medical students worked on eight cases with the chief complaint dyspnea in a laboratory setting using an electronic learning platform, in summary 704 processed cases. The diagnostic steps of the students were tracked and analyzed. Furthermore, after each case the participants stated their presumed diagnosis and explained why they came to their diagnostic conclusion. The content of these explanations was analyzed qualitatively. Results: Based on the diagnostic data gathering process and the students' explanations, eight different causes could be identified of which the lack of diagnostic skills (24\%) and inadequate knowledge base (16\%) were the most common. Other causes that often contributed to a diagnostic error were faulty context generation (15\%) and premature closure (10\%). The causes of misdiagnosis varied per case. Conclusions: Inadequate skills/knowledge and faulty context generation are the major problems in students' clinical reasoning process. These findings are valuable for improving medical education and thus reducing the frequency of diagnostic errors in students' later everyday clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Context: Diagnostic efficiency is important in daily clinical practice as doctors have to face problems within a limited time frame. To foster the clinical reasoning of students is a major challenge in medical education research. Little is known about students’ diagnostic efficiency. On the basis of current theories, scaffolds for case representation (statement of the case as far as it is summarised in the mind) could be a promising approach to make the diagnostic reasoning of intermediate medical students more efficient. Methods: Clinical case processing of 88 medical students in their fourth and fifth years was analysed in a randomised, controlled laboratory study. Cases dealing with dyspnoea were provided in an electronic learning environment (CASUS). Students could freely choose the time, amount and sequence of clinical information. During the learning phase the intervention group was asked to write down case representation summaries while working on the cases. In the assessment phase diagnostic efficiency was operationalised as the number of correct diagnoses divided by the time spent on diagnosing. Results: Diagnostic efficiency was significantly improved by the representation scaffolding (M~=~0.12 [SD~=~0.07], M~=~0.09 [SD~=~0.06] correct cases/time, p~=~0.045), whereas accuracy remained unchanged (M~=~2.28 [SD~=~1.10], M~=~2.09 [SD~=~1.08], p~=~0.52). Both groups screened the same amount of clinical information, but the scaffolding group did this faster (M~=~20.8~minutes [SD~=~7.15], M~=~24.6~minutes [SD~=~7.42], p~=~0.01; Cohen's d~=~0.5). Conclusion: Diagnostic efficiency is an important outcome variable in clinical reasoning research as it corresponds to workplace challenges. Scaffolding for case representations significantly improved the diagnostic efficiency of fourth and fifth-year medical students, most likely because of a more targeted screening of the available information.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical reasoning is one of the central competencies in everyday clinical practice. Diagnostic competence is often measured based on diagnostic accuracy. It is implicitly assumed that a correct diagnosis is based on a proper diagnostic process, although this has never been empirically tested. The frequency and nature of errors in students’ diagnostic processes in correctly solved cases was analyzed in this study. Method: 148 medical students processed 15 virtual patient cases in internal medicine. After each case, they were asked to state their final diagnosis and justify it. These explanations were qualitatively analyzed and assigned to one of the following three categories: 1. correct explanation, 2. incorrect explanation and 3. diagnosis guessed right. Results: The correct diagnosis was made 1,135 times out of 2,080 diagnostic processes. The analysis of the associated diagnostic explanations showed that 1. 92\% (1,042) reasoning processes were correct, 2. 7\% (80) were incorrect, and 3. 1\% (13) of the diagnoses were guessed right. Causes of incorrect diagnostic processes were primarily a lack of pathophysiological knowledge (50\%) and a lack of diagnostic skills (30\%). Conclusion: Generally, if the diagnosis is correct, the diagnostic process is also correct. The rate of guessed diagnoses is quite low at 1\%. Nevertheless, about every 14th correct diagnosis is based on a false diagnostic explanation and thus, a wrong diagnostic process. To assess the diagnostic competence, both the diagnosis result and the diagnostic process should be recorded.},

However, instructors could not warn if a CO student is engaged or not in the course, and they could not predict his or her academic performance in courses. This work provides a collection of models (exploratory factor analysis, multiple linear regressions, cluster analysis, and correlation) to early predict the academic performance of students. These models are constructed using Moodle interaction data, characteristics, and grades of 802 undergraduate students from a CO university. The models result indicated that the major contribution to the prediction of the academic student performance is made by four factors: Access, Questionnaire, Task, and Age. Access factor is composed by variables related to accesses of students in Moodle, including visits to forums and glossaries. Questionnaire factor summarizes variables related to visits and attempts in questionnaires. Task factor is composed of variables related to consulted and submitted tasks. The Age factor contains the student age. Also, it is remarkable that Age was identified as a negative predictor of the performance of students, indicating that the student performance is inversely proportional to age. In addition, cluster analysis found five groups and sustained that number of interactions with Moodle are closely related to performance of students.},

  abstract = {Researchers using survey methods can choose among a variety of methods aimed at detecting insufficient effort responding among the participants in their studies. Some of these methods entail modifying the survey questionnaire by adding bogus items, instructed-response items, or instructed manipulation checks. While these methods have been found effective in detecting insufficient effort responding, it remains unclear whether their presence in a questionnaire can affect responses to items of substantive research interest. We conducted an experiment investigating this potential impact in a sample (N 5 1,092) of working adults. Adopting an invariance testing approach, we assessed whether employing bogus items, instructed-response items, or instructed manipulation checks, with or without warning study participants, respectively, would lead to non-invariant estimates of parameters for substantive variables. Results suggest that, while most parameter estimates were invariant to the use of insufficient effort responding detection methods, the reliability of measurements may be adversely impacted, posing a threat to construct validity and statistical conclusion validity. However, reliability might be maintained when participants are warned at the beginning of the questionnaire. Results also suggest that bogus items may have some advantages over other methods in terms of parameter invariance. We discuss the implications of our findings.},

  abstract = {Student Voices in Teacher Evaluations Brenda Sue Burr Department of Educational Leadership and Foundations, BYU Doctor of Education In an ever increasingly competitive global marketplace, a concern exists that American students are not being adequately prepared with the skills needed for the 21 century. As a remedy, improving quality of teacher instruction is a current national focus. Stakeholders are questioning current infrequent and inefficient methods of evaluating teacher performance. Many states are looking at using a 360 model of evaluating through multiple perspectives including the students themselves as key stakeholders. One method of accessing student voice and adding another perspective to teacher evaluations would be to include student evaluations in the rating of teacher performance, Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET). While using student evaluations of teacher performance is widespread in higher education, the practice has been limited in public school settings until brought to light by the publication of the recent Gates Foundation MET (Measures of Effective Teaching) Project (2010). Currently, states across the nation are considering adding a student input component to teacher evaluations. With the validity and reliability of student evaluations in the university settings still under debate by professors, public school teachers also fear punitive measures and public judgment based on the verdicts of adolescents. This research examined the archival data from a program study of one high school’s student evaluation implementation process, accessing teacher feedback from the initial evaluation process and then an adjusted implementation of student evaluations according to teacher feedback the following year. Based on mixed method design using both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze teacher questionnaires, focus group open-ended responses and statistical analysis of close-ended agree/disagree statements from teacher questionnaires, this study used triangulation to explore teacher reflections on their anxiety levels created by the student evaluation implementation process, the value they found in student evaluations, and the degree to which student evaluations facilitated change in their teaching instruction. Exploring possibilities through the eyes of teachers to reduce their anxiety and increase their value of student input, this study suggests ways to tap into the potential but underutilized resource in schools that could come from developing a mutually beneficial partnership between students and teachers to improve teacher instruction and increase student learning.},

Methods: A multi-phase qualitative focus group study was conducted with 20 faculty at one medical school in the United States during the initial year coaching was implemented. Focus group transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative approach to inductively identify themes from the data. Results: Four main benefits were reported by faculty: student guidance, identifying student issues early, helping students develop work-life balance, and fostering clinician connectivity, which was seen as benefitting both students and faculty. The two main challenges were uncertainty regarding how adaptive the coaching sessions should be, and difficulty engaging in some of the roles simultaneously, like mentoring and supervision. Conclusions: Schools that develop academic medical student coaching programs should design faculty support around coaching and recognize that the process of becoming a coach may not be or feel straightforward for faculty. Overall, faculty found coaching to be rewarding despite challenges they experienced.},

The authors conducted this systematic review to establish the extent, design, and practice of TBL programs within medical schools to inform curriculum planners and education designers. Method: The authors searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and ERIC databases for articles on TBL in undergraduate medical education published between 2002 and 2012. They selected and reviewed articles that included original research on TBL programs and assessed the articles according to the seven core TBL design elements (team formation, readiness assurance, immediate feedback, sequencing of in-class problem solving, the four S's [significant problem, same problem, specific choice, and simultaneous reporting], incentive structure, and peer review) described in established guidelines. Results: The authors identified 20 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. They found significant variability across the articles in terms of the application of the seven core design elements and the depth with which they were described. The majority of the articles, however, reported that TBL provided a positive learning experience for students. Conclusions: In the future, faculty should adhere to a standardized TBL framework to better understand the impact and relative merits of each feature of their program.},

  abstract = {Background: Internationally, medical schools have long used a variety of approaches to develop hybrid Problem based learning (PBL) curricula. However, Team-based learning (TBL), has gained recent popularity in medical education. TBL maintains the advantages of small group teaching and learning, but in contrast to Problem-based learning (PBL), does not require large numbers of tutors. In 2016, TBL was introduced to Year 1 of the Sydney Medical Program (SMP).This study sought to compare students' perceptions of using TBL in place of PBL. Methods: Year 1 students (n = 169) completed three PBL and three TBL sessions during one of the following teaching blocks: Musculoskeletal (n = 56), Respiratory (n = 59) or Cardiovascular (n = 54). Student feedback following completion of each block of teaching was collected by questionnaire, using closed and open ended items. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: In total, 144/169 (85\%) of participants completed a questionnaire regarding PBL, and 152/169 (90\%) completed a similar questionnaire regarding TBL. The students found positive aspects of their TBL experience to include the smaller group size, the use of readiness assurance tests, immediate feedback from senior clinicians, and time efficiency. In PBL, students reported that variable expertise of tutors; limited direction; and large group size hindered their learning. Conclusions: Overwhelmingly, students preferred TBL over PBL, as the optimal teaching strategy. Students found the structure and format of the TBL sessions more conducive to learning, engagement and participation than PBL sessions. Although the use of TBL required an instructional approach, needing direction from the tutor, it remained student-centred, generating a range of positive outcomes. Study results provide confidence to change from PBL to TBL within Year 1 and Year 2 of the SMP in 2017.},

  abstract = {Background: The importance of mentorship within health care training is well recognised. It offers a means to further enhance workforce performance and engagement, promote learning opportunities and encourage multidisciplinary collaboration. There are both career and life benefits associated with mentorship, and it is increasingly recognised as a bidirectional process that benefits both mentors and mentees. Recently, mentoring has been considered an essential~step in professional and~personal development, particularly in the field of health~care. Literature: This article provides a review of the recent literature to assist those considering the implementation of mentorship programmes within their institutions. Discussion includes topics relating to the key elements of effective mentorship, the various phases and styles of mentorship, the need for career-long mentoring, ethical issues and potential difficulties in mentorship. Take-home message: Learning within the workplace includes the development of knowledge and skills, and an understanding of the values important to the profession and the culture of organisations. Within health care training, organisations may encompass hospitals, universities, training organisations and regulatory bodies. The practice of mentorship may help to foster an understanding of the enduring elements of practice within these organisations. Mentoring involves both a coaching and an educational role, requiring a generosity of time, empathy, a willingness to share knowledge and skills, and an enthusiasm for teaching and the success of others. Being mentored is believed to have an important influence on personal development, career guidance and career choice. Ethical issues and potential difficulties in mentorship include conflict of interest, imbalance of power and unrealistic expectations.},

  abstract = {Background: While Problem Based Learning (PBL) has long been established internationally, Team-based learning (TBL) is a relatively new pedagogy in medical curricula. Both PBL and TBL are designed to facilitate a learner-centred approach, where students, in interactive small groups, use peer-assisted learning to solve authentic, professionally relevant problems. Differences, however, exist between PBL and TBL in terms of preparation requirements, group numbers, learning strategies, and class structure. Although there are many similarities and some differences between PBL and TBL, both rely on constructivist learning theory to engage and motivate students in their learning. The aim of our study was to qualitatively explore students' perceptions of having their usual PBL classes run in TBL format. Methods: In 2014, two iterations in a hybrid PBL curriculum were converted to TBL format, with two PBL groups of 10 students each, being combined to form one TBL class of 20, split into four groups of five students. At the completion of two TBL sessions, all students were invited to attend one of two focus groups, with 14 attending. Thematic analysis was used to code and categorise the data into themes, with constructivist theory used as a conceptual framework to identify recurrent themes. Results: Four key themes emerged; guided learning, problem solving, collaborative learning, and critical reflection. Although structured, students were attracted to the active and collaborative approach of TBL. They perceived the key advantages of TBL to include the smaller group size, the preparatory Readiness Assurance Testing process, facilitation by a clinician, an emphasis on basic science concepts, and immediate feedback. The competitiveness of TBL was seen as a spur to learning. These elements motivated students to prepare, promoted peer assisted teaching and learning, and focussed team discussion. An important advantage of PBL over TBL, was the opportunity for adequate clinical reasoning within the problem solving activity. Conclusion: Students found their learning experience in TBL and PBL qualitatively different. There were advantages and disadvantages to both. This suggests a hybrid approach utilising the strengths of both methods should be considered for wide scale implementation.},

  abstract = {Background: With increased student numbers in the Sydney Medical Program, and concerns regarding standardisation across cohorts, student satisfaction of the problem-based learning (PBL) model had decreased in recent years. In 2017, Team-based learning (TBL) replaced PBL in Years 1 and 2 of the medical program. This study sought to explore students’ perceptions of their experience of TBL, and to consider resource implications. Methods: In 2017, Years 1 and 2 medical students (n~= 625) participated in weekly TBL sessions, with approximately 60 students per class, consisting of 11 teams of five or six students. Each class was facilitated by a consultant, a basic scientist and a medical registrar. Prior to each class, students were given pre-work, and completed an online Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT). During face-to-face class, students completed the Team Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT), and received feedback with clarification from facilitators, followed by clinical problem-solving activities. Student feedback was collected by questionnaire, using closed and open-ended items. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: In total, 232/275 (84\%) Year 1 and 258/350 (74\%) Year 2 students responded to the questionnaire. Students found positive aspects of TBL included the small group dynamics, intra- and inter-team discussions, interactions with facilitators, provision of clinical contexts by clinicians, and the readiness assurance process. Suggested improvements included: better alignment of pre-reading tasks, shorter class time, increased opportunity for clinical reasoning, and additional feedback on the mechanistic flowchart. Resource efficiencies were identified, such as a reduction in the number of teaching sessions and required facilitators, and the ability to provide each classroom with clinical expertise. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that TBL, as a replacement for PBL in Years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, provided a standardised approach to small group learning on a large scale, and also provided resource efficiencies. Students perceived benefits related to the active learning strategy of TBL that encourage individual learning, consolidation of knowledge, retrieval practice, peer discussion and feedback. However, improvements are needed in terms of better alignment of pre-reading tasks with the TBL patient case, and greater facilitator interaction during the problem-solving activities. Additionally, consideration should be given to reducing class time, and providing TRAT scores.},

It is facilitated through phases of individual work, teamwork with immediate feedback and an application exercise, to develop students’ understanding and assessment of conceptual knowledge. A single facilitator can manage many groups within larger lectures. The study aim was to evaluate the impact of TBL on the engagement, learning and satisfaction of students enrolled in a transnational post registration Bachelor of Nursing (BN) program in Singapore. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed. The TBL approach was delivered during lecture sessions within a post registration BN program delivered in a Higher Education Institution in Singapore. A sample of BN students was drawn from 305 students undertaking the program. An online anonymous university-delivered student evaluation of course (SEC) survey and an online anonymous survey using the Student Assessment Instrument, were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Survey participation was voluntary with informed consent protocols followed. Student performance in the course was also reviewed. Results: Eighty-two students (27\%) completed the SEC scoring a median of 4/5 for satisfaction, and 68 (22\%) completed the online survey. As 93 was the neutral score for the survey, there was a moderately positive evaluation with an overall score of 108.5/155 for TBL in accountability for learning, TBL preference and satisfaction with TBL compared to traditional lecture approaches. Conclusions: Implementation of TBL with this cohort demonstrated evidence of moderately positive engagement, learning and satisfaction when compared to traditional didactic lectures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The term "learning style" refers to the fact that each person has a different way of accumulating knowledge. While some prefer listening to learn better, others need to write or they only need to read the text or see a picture to later remember. According to Fleming and Mills the learning styles can be classified in Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic. There is no evidence that teaching according to the learning style can help a person, yet this cannot be ignored. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In this study, a number of 230 medical students were questioned in order to determine their learning style. RESULTS We determined that 73\% of the students prefer one learning style, 22\% prefer to learn using equally two learning style, while the rest prefer three learning styles. According to this study the distribution of the learning styles is as following: 33\% visual, 26\% auditory, 14\% kinesthetic, 12\% visual and auditory styles equally, 6\% visual and kinesthetic, 4\% auditory and kinesthetic and 5\% all three styles. 32 \% of the students that participated at this study are from UMF Craiova, 32\% from UMF Carol Davila, 11\% University of Medicine T Popa, Iasi, 9\% UMF Cluj Iulius Hatieganu. DISCUSSIONS The way medical students learn is different from the general population. This is why it is important when teaching to considerate how the students learn in order to facilitate the learning.},

  abstract = {Purpose A better understanding of how communication skills education impacts trainees' communication skills is important for continual improvement in graduate medical education (GME). Guided by the Kirkpatrick Model, this review focused on studies that measured communication skills in either simulated or clinical settings. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effect of experiential communication skills education on GME trainees' communication behaviors. Method Five databases were searched for studies published between 2001 and 2021 using terms representing the concepts of medical trainees, communication, training, and skills and/or behaviors. Included studies had an intervention design, focused only on GME trainees as learners, used experiential methods, and had an outcome measure of communication skills behavior that was assessed by a simulated or standardized patient (SP), patient, family member, or outside observer. Studies were examined for differences in outcomes based on study design; simulated versus clinical evaluation setting; outside observer versus SP, patient, or family member evaluator; and length of training. Results Seventy-seven studies were ultimately included. Overall, 54 (70\%) studies reported some positive findings (i.e., change in behavior). There were 44 (57\%) single-group pre-post studies, 13 (17\%) nonrandomized control studies, and 20 (26\%) randomized control studies. Positive findings were frequent in single-group designs (80\%) and were likely in nonrandomized (62\%) and randomized (55\%) control trials. Positive findings were likely in studies evaluating communication behavior in simulated (67\%) and clinical (78\%) settings as well as in studies with outside observer (63\%) and SP, patient, and family member (64\%) evaluators. Conclusions This review demonstrates strong support that experiential communication skills education can impact GME trainees' communication behaviors. Marked heterogeneity in communication trainings and evaluation measures, even among subgroups, did not allow for meta-analysis or comparative efficacy evaluation of different studies. Future studies would benefit from homogeneity in curricular and evaluation measures.},

The results indicated that low psychological need satisfaction related to poor sleep quality, lower sleep quantity, and more daytime dysfunction. Finally, mindfulness and financial strain related, respectively, negatively and positively to poor sleep quality and daytime dysfunction through need satisfaction, suggesting that need satisfaction represents a critical explanatory mechanism. The role of psychological need satisfaction in the adequate regulation and satisfaction of the physiological need for sleep is discussed.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Currently, abdominal obesity has reached an epidemic stage and obesity represents an important challenge for worldwide health authorities. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the stone risk incidence increases with Body Mass Index, through multiple pathways. Metabolic syndrome and diabetes are associated with an increased renal stones disease incidence. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence, morbidity, risk factors involved in the association between obesity and urolithiasis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The search involved finding relevant studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and individual urological journals between January 2001 and May 2017. The inclusion criteria were for studies written in the English language, reporting on the association between obesity and urinary stones. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The underlying pathophysiology of stone formation in obese patients is thought to be related to insulin resistance, dietary factors, and a lithogenic urinary profile. Uric acid stones and calcium oxalate stones are observed frequently in these patients. Insulin resistance is thought to alter the renal acid-base metabolism, resulting in a lower urine pH, and increasing the risk of uric acid stone disease. Obesity is also associated with excess nutritional intake of lithogenic substances and with an increase in urinary tract infection incidence. Recent studies highlighted that renal stone disease increases the risk of myocardial infarction, progression of chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Contempo¬ rary, bariatric surgery has been shown to be associated with hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy. Certainly, the many health risks of obesity, including nephrolithiasis, will add more burden on urologists and nephrologists. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity related nephrolithiasis seems to necessitate weight loss as primary treatment, but the recognition of the associated complications is necessary to prevent induction of new and equally severe medical problems. The optimal approach to obesity control that minimizes stone risk needs to be determined in order to manage obesity-induced renal stones disease.},

  abstract = {Graduate medical education (GME) and Clinical Competency Committees (CCC) have been evolving to monitor trainee progression using competency-based medical education principles and outcomes, though evidence suggests CCCs fall short of this goal. Challenges include that evaluation data are often incomplete, insufficient, poorly aligned with performance, conflicting or of unknown quality, and CCCs struggle to organize, analyze, visualize, and integrate data elements across sources, collection methods, contexts, and time-periods, which makes advancement decisions difficult. Learning analytics have significant potential to improve competence committee decision making, yet their use is not yet commonplace. Learning analytics (LA) is the interpretation of multiple data sources gathered on trainees to assess academic progress, predict future performance, and identify potential issues to be addressed with feedback and individualized learning plans. What distinguishes LA from other educational approaches is systematic data collection and advanced digital interpretation and visualization to inform educational systems. These data are necessary to: 1) fully understand educational contexts and guide improvements; 2) advance proficiency among stakeholders to make ethical and accurate summative decisions; and 3) clearly communicate methods, findings, and actionable recommendations for a range of educational stakeholders. The ACGME released the third edition CCC Guidebook for Programs in 2020 and the 2021 Milestones 2.0 supplement of the Journal of Graduate Medical Education (JGME Supplement) presented important papers that describe evaluation and implementation features of effective CCCs. Principles of LA underpin national GME outcomes data and training across specialties; however, little guidance currently exists on how GME programs can use LA to improve the CCC process. Here we outline recommendations for implementing learning analytics for supporting decision making on trainee progress in two areas: 1) Data Quality and Decision Making, and 2) Educator Development.},

With the aim of shedding light on the extent and diversity of the research outcomes, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies worldwide on this topic to assess whether the exam scores of students included in ARS experiments achieve better results than others taught using more conventional teaching tools. From an initial sample of 254 studies, data from 51 papers published between 2008 and 2012 (involving 14,963 participants) that set academic quality criteria, were extracted and analyzed following technical protocols for meta-analyses. Their high degree of heterogeneity shows that the effect of ARS on exam scores seems to be moderated by specific features. So, through a random-effects model, our results provide a positive, although moderated pooled effect of ARS on examination scores that is much greater in experiments performed in non-university contexts (Hedges' g = 0.48; S.E. =.2665) than at the university level (Hedge's g = 0.22, S.E. =.0434). Specifically, the categories of university disciplines in which ARS interventions are implemented seem to influence their usefulness for achieving better academic marks, being more effective when either Pure Soft Sciences or Applied Hard Sciences are considered. These findings might provide guidance for governments, researchers and educators into the effectiveness of learning based on the new interactive technologies.},

  abstract = {The existing structure of physician education has developed in siloed stages, with consecutive degrees and certifications and progressively longer training programs. As further fragmentation of health care and training systems will not improve the quality of care and education, the authors argue that a new vision of education, training, and practice as a continuum is needed. They advocate for a model of competency-based medical education that merges with competency-based medical practice. In this system, education and training will result in individual, dynamic portfolios of valid entrustable professional activities (EPAs) for which physicians are certified. Physicians can maintain and renew that entrustment as long as the EPAs remain within their scope of practice. Entrustment occurs initially during training but is then granted for new activities as physicians' careers evolve. This model accounts for the need to keep pace with changes in population health needs and expectations of competence over time. It de-emphasizes the divides between the stages of training and views the continuum from undergraduate medical education until retirement as a whole. Key obligations of self-regulating medical professionals include both the reception and the provision of supervision from and for others, respectively. Learning must be embedded in practice to address expectations regarding new knowledge and skills as they evolve with scientific and technological advances. Entrusting physicians to deliver effective and safe care, based on their performance of the requisite EPAs without supervision, should ensure that they provide high-value, quality care to patients.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: When gauging diagnostic accuracy cognitive biases may lead to inaccurate estimates of certainty, predisposing clinicians to diagnostic errors. This study explored the relationship between diagnostic accuracy and measures of certainty for diagnoses based on consistent or inconsistent information. METHOD: The authors analyzed three experiments among 180 to 190 postgraduate trainees performing cardiac physical diagnoses using a simulator from 2010 to 2012. Each asked participants to assess diagnostic certainty. One experiment used a seven-point certainty scale and provided only simulated physical findings. Two assessed certainty continuously (probability 1\%-100\%) and included cases with inconsistent clinical information in addition to simulated physical findings. Relationships between certainty and accuracy were explored through descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Measures of certainty ranged widely (between 2 and 7, and 5\%-100\%). Relationships between accuracy and certainty varied depending on information consistency. In experiments providing only simulated findings, or consistent clinical data, diagnostic accuracy was associated with higher certainty (median 90\% versus 75\%, and 5/7 versus 4/7, both P {$<$} .001). Studies providing inconsistent data generated similar certainty among participants regardless of accuracy (median 75\% versus 75\%, P = .36; and 80\% versus 85\%, P = .60). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic accuracy was moderately associated with higher certainty only when clinical data were consistent. This correlation disappeared when incon sistent data were provided, possi bly reflecting changes in reasoning strategies among diagnostically success ful trainees. The relationship between certainty and diagnostic accuracy is context dependent. Certainty is an unreliable surrogate for diagnostic accuracy.},

The individual and combined effect of weekly formative assessments and cumulative assessments on final exam performance was studied. Methods Students were placed into 6 groups by weekly formative assessment performance and practice exam utilization/performance. Students who scored below the median on weekly assessments comprised groups 1/3/5. Groups 2/4/6 scored above the median. Groups 1/2 did not use the practice exam. Groups 3/4 scored below the median on the practice exam while Groups 5/6 scored above. Multiple comparisons were made using ANCOVA. Results Adjusted analysis showed weekly assessment and practice exam performance had a significant relationship with final exam performance (F[7,145]=18.765, p{$<$}0.0005). Groups 2/4/6 performed better on the final exam than groups 1/3/5 respectively (1v2, 80.8\% vs 88.0\%, p{$<$}0.0005 || 3v4, 83.4\% vs 88.6\%, p{$<$}0.0005 || 5v6, 84.1\% vs 90.1\%, p{$<$}0.0005). Group 1 performed worse than group 3 (80.8\% vs 83.4\%, p=0.072) and group 5 (80.8\% vs 84.1\%, p=0.047). Discussion Performance on weekly formative assessments was predictive of final exam scores. Struggling medical students will benefit from extra cumulative practice exams while students who are excelling do not need extra practice.},

As such, this article focuses only on the prevention of STIs for the victims who are reproductive–aged women. The etiologic organisms of STIs are bacteria, viruses and insects, of which each has different incubation period, target cells and long-term effects. The STI prophylactic medications aims to prevent human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, syphilis and trichomoniasis. However, some STIs are as important owing to the recurrence nature and the life-ling seropositivity.

  abstract = {Problem: Training the next generation of health professionals requires leaders, innovators, and scholars in education. Although many medical schools and residencies offer education electives or tracks focused on developing teaching skills, these programs often omit educational innovation, scholarship, and leadership and are narrowly targeted to one level of learner. Intervention: The University of California San Francisco created the Health Professions Education Pathway for medical students, residents, and fellows as well as learners from other health professional schools. The Pathway applies the theoretical framework of communities of practice in its curricular design to promote learner identity formation as future health professions educators. It employs the strategies of engagement, imagination, and alignment for identity formation. Context: Through course requirements, learners engage and work with members of the educator community of practice to develop the knowledge and skills required to participate in the community. Pathway instructors are faculty members who model a breadth of educator careers to help learners imagine personal trajectories. Last, learners complete mentored education projects, adopting scholarly methods and ethics to align with the broader educator community of practice. Outcome: From 2009 to 2014, 117 learners participated in the Pathway. Program evaluations, graduate surveys, and web-based searches revealed positive impacts on learner career development. Learners gained knowledge and skills for continued engagement with the educator community of practice, confirmed their career aspirations (imagination), joined an educator-in-training community (engagement/imagination), and disseminated via scholarly meetings and peer-reviewed publications (alignment). Lessons Learned: Learners identified engagement with the learner community as the most powerful aspect of the Pathway; it provided peer support for imagining and navigating the development of their dual identities in the clinician and educator communities of practice. Also important for learner success was alignment of their projects with the goals of the local educator community of practice. Our community of practice approach to educator career development has shown promising early outcomes by nurturing learners' passion for teaching; expanding their interest in educational leadership, innovation, and scholarship; and focusing on their identity formation as future educators.},

We used 2 frameworks for the analysis: “experiences, trajectories and reifications” and “description, justification and clarification.” Results: We included 90 studies, of which 55 focused on resident experiences, 29 on trajectories and 6 on reification. We classified 44 studies as “description,” 38 as “justification” and 8 as “clarification.” In the description studies, 12 compared academic half days with noon conferences, 23 described specific teaching topics, and 9 focused on resources needed for CBE. Justification studies examined the effects of CBE on outcomes, such as examination scores (17) and use of teaching strategies in team-based learning, principles of adult learning and e-learning (15). Of the 8 clarification studies, topics included the role of CBE in PGME, stakeholder perspectives and transfer of knowledge between classroom and workplace. Interpretation: Much of the existing literature is either a description of various aspects of CBE or justification of particular teaching strategies. Few studies exist on how and why CBE works; future studies should aim to clarify how CBE facilitates resident learning within the sociocultural framework of PGME.},

  abstract = {Through the measure of thousands of small-molecule metabolites in diverse biological systems, metabolomics now offers the potential for new insights into the factors that contribute to complex human diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Targeted metabolomics methods have already identified new molecular markers and metabolomic signatures of cardiovascular disease risk (including branched-chain amino acids, select unsaturated lipid species, and trimethylamine-N-oxide), thus in effect linking diverse exposures such as those from dietary intake and the microbiota with cardiometabolic traits. As technologies for metabolomics continue to evolve, the depth and breadth of small-molecule metabolite profiling in complex systems continue to advance rapidly, along with prospects for ongoing discovery. Current challenges facing the field of metabolomics include scaling throughput and technical capacity for metabolomics approaches, bioinformatic and chemoinformatic tools for handling large-scale metabolomics data, methods for elucidating the biochemical structure and function of novel metabolites, and strategies for determining the true clinical relevance of metabolites observed in association with cardiovascular disease outcomes. Progress made in addressing these challenges will allow metabolomics the potential to substantially affect diagnostics and therapeutics in cardiovascular medicine.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Benefits of the active involvement of patients in educating health professionals are well-recognized but little is known about how patient educators facilitate student learning. Method: This exploratory qualitative study investigated the teaching practices and experiences that prepared patient educators for their roles in a longitudinal interprofessional Health Mentors program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven experienced health mentors. Responses were coded and analyzed for themes related to teaching goals, methods, and prior experiences. Results: Mentors used a rich variety of teaching methods to teach patient-centeredness and interprofessionalism, categorized as: telling my story, stimulating reflection, sharing perspectives, and problem-solving. As educators they drew on a variety of prior experiences with teaching, facilitation or public speaking and long-term interactions with the health-care system. Conclusions: Patient educators use diverse teaching methods, drawing on both individualistic and social perspectives on learning. A peer-support model of training and support would help maintain the authenticity of patients as educators. The study highlights inadequacies of current learning theories to explain how patients help students learn.},

  abstract = {One of the important processes in kidney stone development is crystal invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). Some proteins in renal tissue or urine have been thought to aggravate crystal invasion. However, this pathogenic mechanism has been previously under-investigated due to a lack of crystal invasion assay. In the present study, we have developed a novel assay for the investigations of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystal invasion. Matrix gel was loaded into an in-house migration chamber made on a glass slide to simulate the ECM environment. COM crystals were coated with the tested protein, which was then bound with plasminogen. The crystal-protein-(plasminogen) complex and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were placed on-top of the matrix gel. If the tested protein had plasminogen-binding capability, the remaining plasminogen would be activated by uPA to plasmin, which caused crystal migration through the matrix gel. We then applied this novel assay to evaluate effects of some abundant kidney/urine proteins (including purified albumin, carbonic anhydrase, lysozyme and Tamm-Horsfall protein) on COM crystal invasion. The data revealed that albumin, which is the known plasminogen-binding protein, dramatically induced plasmin activity and crystal invasion, whereas other proteins had no significant effects as compared to the control. In summary, we have successfully developed a novel assay for the investigations of crystal invasion based on the plasminogen/plasmin system. This assay is applicable to examine proteins that may serve as potential aggravators of crystal invasion and thus will be very useful for further studies on kidney stone development. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports a case study which demonstrates the feasibility of practising LA at a low cost for instructors to identify at-risk students in an undergraduate business quantitative methods course. Instead of using tracking data from a learning management system as predictive variables, this study utilised clicker responses as formative assessments, together with student demographic data and summative assessments. This LA practice makes use of free cloud services, Google Forms and Google Sheets in particular for collecting and analysing clicker data. Despite a small dataset being used, the LA implementation was effective in identifying at-risk students at an early stage. A systematic proactive advising approach is proposed as an intervention strategy based on students’ at-risk probability estimated by a prediction model. The result shows that the intervention success rate increases correspondingly with the number of interventions and the intervention effects on peer groups are far more successful than on individual students. Overall, the students’ pass rate in the study was 7\% higher than that for the whole course. Practical recommendations and concerns about using linear regression and logistic regression for classification are also discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Various purine-rich foods and high protein intake have long been thought to be risk factors for gout. Similarly, the possibility that the consumption of dairy products has a role in protecting against gout has been raised by metabolic studies. We prospectively investigated the association of these dietary factors with new cases of gout. METHODS Over a 12-year period, we prospectively examined the relationship between purported dietary risk factors and new cases of gout among 47,150 men who had no history of gout at base line. We used a supplementary questionnaire to ascertain whether participants met the American College of Rheumatology survey criteria for gout. Diet was assessed every four years by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS During the 12 years of the study, we documented 730 confirmed new cases of gout. The multivariate relative risk of gout among men in the highest quintile of meat intake, as compared with those in the lowest quintile, was 1.41 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.86; P for trend = 0.02), and the corresponding relative risk associated with seafood intake was 1.51 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.95; P for trend = 0.02). In contrast, the incidence of gout decreased with increasing intake of dairy products; the multivariate relative risk among men in the highest quintile, as compared with those in the lowest quintile, was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.74; P for trend {$<$}0.001). The level of consumption of purine-rich vegetables and the total protein intake were not associated with an increased risk of gout. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption of dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased risk of gout.},

Similarly, both hypertension and diuretic use have been considered risk factors for gout; however, their independent contributions have not been established prospectively. Methods: We prospectively examined over a 12-year period (1986-1998) the relation between adiposity, weight change, hypertension, and diuretic use and incident gout in 47 150 male participants with no history of gout at baseline. We used a supplementary questionnaire to ascertain the American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout. Results: During 12 years we documented 730 confirmed incident cases of gout. Compared with men with a body mass index (BMI) of 21 to 22.9, the multivariate relative risks (RRs) of gout were 1.95 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-2.65) for men with a BMI of 25 to 29.9, 2.33 (95\% 61, 1.62-3.36) for men with a BMI of 30 to 34.9, and 2.97 (95\% CI, 1.73-5.10) for men with a BMI of 35 or greater (P for trend {$<$}.001). Compared with men who had maintained their weight (±4 lb) since age 21 years, the multivariate RR of gout for men who had gained 30 lb or more since age 21 years was 1.99 (95\% CI, 1.49-2.66). In contrast, the multivariate RR for men who had lost 10 lb or more since the study baseline was 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.40-0.92). The multivariate RRs of gout were 2.31 (95\% CI, 1.96-2.72) for the presence of hypertension and 1.77 (95\% CI, 1.42-2.20) for diuretic use. Conclusions: Higher adiposity and weight gain are strong risk factors for gout in men, while weight loss is protective. Hypertension and diuretic use are also important independent risk factors for gout.},

Results Compared to MD only students, MD/MPH applicants had a higher propensity towards primary care specialties. MD/PhD applicants did not differ versus MD only applicants in their selection of primary care specialties, or of competitive specialties. MD/MBA applicants chose more competitive specialties and less primary care specialties. Despite all these differences, match rates were not different comparing MD only and dual-degree students.

Dyslipidemia is a known independent risk factor for urolithiasis, and emerging evidence suggests common biological pathways. Previous work has suggested that statins protect against new stone formation, but these findings have not been verified by other investigators. METHODS: We queried our Institution's Electronic Data Warehouse for all patients who were newly diagnosed with hyperlipidemia between 2009 and 2011, and had never taken a statin drug. These patients' clinical outcomes were followed until 2015, to assess whether they had been newly prescribed statins and whether they had developed symptomatic urolithiasis. Patient demographics, stone risk factors, prescription data, and serum lipid values were collected. RESULTS: A total of 101,259 patients met inclusion criteria, 47.8\% of whom received a statin prescription during the study period. Patients prescribed statins were significantly older, had a greater likelihood of osteoporosis, hemiplegia, immobility, and more likely to take a thiazide diuretic. Patients without a history of urolithiasis who were started on statin therapy were significantly less likely to develop new stones than patients not taking statins. This protective effect was even greater in patients with a history of stone disease. Lipid parameters (low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, cholesterol) were lower in the statin-treated group, suggesting overall compliance with these medications. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm previous work that statins protect against urinary stone formation; however, the underlying mechanism seems to be distinct from statins' lipid-lowering effect.},

The authors explored whether adding a not yet pass (NYP) grade to a P/F scale would promote students' mastery orientation toward learning. Approach: The authors captured student outcomes and data on time and cost of implementing the NYP grade in 2021 at the University of Utah School of Medicine. One cohort of medical students, who had experienced both P/F and P/NYP/F scales in years 1 and 2, completed an adapted Achievement Goal Questionnaire-Revised (AGQ-R) in fall 2021 to measure how well the P/ NYP/F grading scale compared with the P/F scale promoted mastery orientation and performance orientation goals. Students who received an NYP grade provided feedback on the NYP process. Outcomes: Students reported that the P/NYP/F scale increased their achievement of both mastery and performance orientation goals, with significantly higher ratings for mastery orientation goals than for performance orientation goals on the AGQ-R (response rate = 124/125 [99\%], P ≤ .001, effect size = 0.31). Thirty-eight students received 48 NYP grades in 7 courses during 2021, and 3 (2\%) failed a subsequent course after receiving an NYP grade. Most NYP students reported the NYP process enabled them to identify and correct a deficiency (32/36 [89\%]) and made them feel supported (28/36 [78\%]). The process was time intensive (897 hours total for 48 NYP grades), but no extra funding was budgeted. Next Steps: The findings suggest mastery orientation can be increased with an NYP grade. Implementing a P/NYP/F grading scale for years 1 and/or 2 may help students transition to programmatic assessment or no grading later in medical school, which may better prepare graduates for lifelong learning.},

Among the 143 participants (36.4\%) who supplied complete demographic and Kolb data, Kolb learning styles included diverging (45; 31.5\%), assimilating (56; 39.2\%), converging (8; 5.6\%), and accommodating (34; 23.8\%). Associations existed between learning style and gender (p = 0.02). For most men, learning styles were diverging (23 of 63; 36.5\%) and assimilating (30 of 63; 47.6\%); for most women, diverging (22 of 80; 27.5\%), assimilating (26 of 80; 32.5\%), and accommodating (26 of 80; 32.5\%). Conclusions: Internal medicine and psychiatry CME participants had diverse learning styles. Female participants had more variation in their learning styles than men. Teaching techniques must vary to appeal to all learners. The experiential learning theory sequentially moves a learner from Why? to What? to How? to If? to accommodate learning styles.},

  abstract = {Aims and objectives: To explore the use and student outcomes of Team-Based Learning in nursing education. Background: Team-Based Learning is a highly structured, evidence-based, student-centred learning strategy that enhances student engagement and facilitates deep learning in a variety of disciplines including nursing. However, the breadth of Team-Based Learning application in nursing education and relevant outcomes are not currently well understood. Design: A scoping review of international, peer-reviewed research studies was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. Methods: The following databases were searched on 7 May 2020: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO and Education Resources Information Center. Search terms related to nursing, education and Team-Based Learning. Original research studies, published in English, and reporting on student outcomes from Team-Based Learning in nursing education programmes were included. Results: Of the 1081 potentially relevant citations, 41 studies from undergraduate (n~=~29), postgraduate (n~=~4) and hospital (n~=~8) settings were included. The most commonly reported student outcomes were knowledge or academic performance (n~=~21); student experience, satisfaction or perceptions of Team-Based Learning (n~=~20); student engagement with behaviours or attitudes towards Team-Based Learning (n~=~12); and effect of Team-Based Learning on teamwork, team performance or collective efficacy (n~=~6). Only three studies reported clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Over the last decade, there has been a growing body of knowledge related to the use of Team-Based Learning in nursing education. The major gaps identified in this scoping review were the lack of randomised controlled trials and the dearth of studies of Team-Based Learning in postgraduate and hospital contexts. Relevance to clinical practice: This scoping review provides a comprehensive understanding of the use and student outcomes of Team-Based Learning in nursing education and highlights the breadth of application of Team-Based Learning and variability in the outcomes reported.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Competency-based education requires individualization of instruction. Mastery learning, an instructional approach requiring learners to achieve a defined proficiency before proceeding to the next instructional objective, offers one approach to individualization. The authors sought to summarize the quantitative outcomes of mastery learning simulation-based medical education (SBME) in comparison with no intervention and nonmastery instruction, and to determine what features of mastery SBME make it effective. Method: The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, key journals, and previous review bibliographies through May 2011. They included original research in any language evaluating mastery SBME, in comparison with any intervention or no intervention, for practicing and student physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Working in duplicate, they abstracted information on trainees, instructional design (interactivity, feedback, repetitions, and learning time), study design, and outcomes. Results: They identified 82 studies evaluating mastery SBME. In comparison with no intervention, mastery SBME was associated with large effects on skills (41 studies; effect size [ES] 1.29 [95\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.50]) and moderate effects on patient outcomes (11 studies; ES 0.73 [95\% CI, 0.36-1.10]). In comparison with nonmastery SBME instruction, mastery learning was associated with large benefit in skills (3 studies; effect size 1.17 [95\% CI, 0.29-2.05]) but required more time. Pretraining and additional practice improved outcomes but, again, took longer. Studies exploring enhanced feedback and self-regulated learning in the mastery model showed mixed results. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that mastery learning SBME is superior to nonmastery instruction but takes more time.},

  abstract = {Ongoing transformations in health professions education underscore the need for valid and reliable assessment. The current standard for assessment validation requires evidence from five sources: content, response process, internal structure, relations with other variables, and consequences. However, researchers remain uncertain regarding the types of data that contribute to each evidence source. We sought to enumerate the validity evidence sources and supporting data elements for assessments using technology-enhanced simulation. We conducted a systematic literature search including MEDLINE, ERIC, and Scopus through May 2011. We included original research that evaluated the validity of simulation-based assessment scores using two or more evidence sources. Working in duplicate, we abstracted information on the prevalence of each evidence source and the underlying data elements. Among 217 eligible studies only six (3 \%) referenced the five-source framework, and 51 (24 \%) made no reference to any validity framework. The most common evidence sources and data elements were: relations with other variables (94 \% of studies; reported most often as variation in simulator scores across training levels), internal structure (76 \%; supported by reliability data or item analysis), and content (63 \%; reported as expert panels or modification of existing instruments). Evidence of response process and consequences were each present in {$<$}10 \% of studies. We conclude that relations with training level appear to be overrepresented in this field, while evidence of consequences and response process are infrequently reported. Validation science will be improved as educators use established frameworks to collect and interpret evidence from the full spectrum of possible sources and elements. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Methods: Secondary school students participating in a medical simulation-based training activity participated in a randomized experiment. Each participant completed eight repetitions of a blood vessel ligation. Once, between repetitions four and five, each participant received a randomly-assigned speed goal or quality goal. Outcomes included time and leak-free ligatures. Results: 80 students participated. The speed-goal group performed 18\% faster on the final repetition than the quality-goal group, with adjusted fold change (FC) 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71, 0.94; p = 0.01). Conversely, the speed-goal group had fewer high-quality (leak-free) ligatures (odds ratio [OR] 0.36 [95\% CI, 0.22, 0.58; p {$<$} 0.001]). For the quality-goal group, leaky ligatures took longer post-intervention than leak-free ligatures (FC 1.09 [95\% CI, 1.02, 1.17; p = 0.01]), whereas average times for leaky and leak-free ligatures were similar for the speed-goal group (FC 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.91, 1.04; p = 0.38]). For a given performance time, the speed-goal group had more leaks post-intervention than the quality-goal group (OR 3.35 [95\% CI, 1.58, 7.10; p = 0.002]). Conclusions: Speed and quality goals promote different learning processes and outcomes among novices. Use of both speed and quality goals may facilitate more effective and efficient learning.},

  abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, the prevalence of anxiety has increased among college-aged students and college counseling centers have become increasingly concerned about the negative impact of anxiety on students. While college in general can be stressful, college science classrooms have the potential to be especially anxietyinducing because of the sometimes chilly and competitive environment of the class. Further, college science courses are increasingly being transitioned from traditional lecture to active learning where students take an active role in their learning, often through participating in activities such as clicker questions and group work. There is emerging evidence that suggests active learning activities may cause students to feel anxious, but no studies have thoroughly explored why active learning activities in science courses may increase students’ anxiety. Further, no studies have explored whether active learning activities can reduce students’ anxiety. In this exploratory interview study of 52 students enrolled in large-enrollment active learning college science courses, we investigate how three active learning practices, clicker questions, group work, and cold call/random call, increase and decrease students’ anxiety. Results: Students reported that clicker questions and group work had the potential to both increase and decrease their anxiety. The way the active learning activity is implemented and the extent to which students perceive they benefit from the activity seems to influence the effect of the activity on students’ anxiety. Conversely, students reported that cold call and random call only increased their anxiety. From our interviews, we identified the fear of negative evaluation, or the sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated while participating in a social situation, as the primary construct underlying students’ high levels of anxiety associated with speaking out in front of the whole class when they do not volunteer. Conclusion: This study illustrates that active learning can both increase and decrease students’ anxiety depending on the way active learning is implemented. We hope that this study encourages instructors to create more inclusive active learning science courses by implementing active learning in ways that minimize students’ anxiety.},

  abstract = {Context Assessment in the workplace is important, but many evaluations have shown that assessor agreement and discrimination are poor. Training discussions suggest that assessors find conventional scales invalid. We evaluate scales constructed to reflect developing clinical sophistication and independence in parallel with conventional scales. Methods A valid scale should reduce assessor disagreement and increase assessor discrimination. We compare conventional and construct-aligned scales used in parallel to assess approximately 2000 medical trainees by each of three methods of workplace-based assessment (WBA): the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX); the acute care assessment tool (ACAT), and the case-based discussion (CBD). We evaluate how scores reflect assessor disagreement (Vj and Vj*p) and assessor discrimination (Vp), and we model reliability using generalisability theory. Results In all three cases the conventional scale gave a performance similar to that in previous evaluations, but the construct-aligned scales substantially reduced assessor disagreement and substantially increased assessor discrimination. Reliability modelling shows that, using the new scales, the number of assessors required to achieve a generalisability coefficient ≥0.70 fell from six to three for the mini-CEX, from eight to three for the CBD, from 10 to nine for 'on-take' ACAT, and from 30 to 12 for 'post-take' ACAT. Conclusions The results indicate that construct-aligned scales have greater utility, both because they are more reliable and because that reliability provides evidence of greater validity. There is also a wider implication: the disappointing reliability of existing WBA methods may reflect not assessors' differing assessments of performance, but, rather, different interpretations of poorly aligned scales. Scales aligned to the expertise of clinician-assessors and the developing independence of trainees may improve confidence in WBA. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2011.},

  abstract = {A variety of factors influence the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones, including gender, diet, and urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, and uric acid. Several of these factors may be related to body size. Because men on average have a larger body size and a threefold higher lifetime risk of stone formation than women, body size may be an important risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation. The association between body size (height, weight, and body mass index) and the risk of kidney stone formation was studied in two large cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 89,376 women) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; n = 51,529 men). Information on body size, kidney stone formation, and other exposures of interest was obtained by mailed questionnaires. A total of 1078 incident cases of kidney stones in NHS during 14 yr of follow-up and a total of 956 cases in HPFS during 8 yr of follow-up were confirmed. In both cohorts, the prevalence of a stone disease history and the incidence of stone disease were directly associated with weight and body mass index. However, the magnitude of the associations was consistently greater among women. Specifically, the age-adjusted prevalence odds ratio for women with body mass index ≤32 kg/m2 compared with 21 to 22.9 kg/m2 was 1.76 (95\% confidence interval, 1.50 to 2.07), but 1.38 (95\% confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.65)for the same comparison in men. For incident stone formation, the multivariate relative risks for the similar comparisons were 1.89 (1.51 to 2.36) for women and 1.19 (0.83 to 1.70) in men. Height was inversely associated with the prevalence of stone disease but was not associated with incident stone formation. These results suggest that body size is associated with the risk of stone formation and that the magnitude of risk varies by gender. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether a reduction in body weight decreases the risk of stone formation, particularly in women.},

Participants: 81 093 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were 40 to 65 years of age in 1986 and had no history of kidney stones. Measurements: Beverage use and diet were assessed in 1986 and 1990 with a validated, self-administered food- frequency questionnaire. The main outcome measure was incident symptomatic kidney stones. Results: During 553 081 person-years of follow-up over an 8- year period, 719 cases of kidney stones were documented. After risk factors other than fluid intake were controlled for, the relative risk for stone formation for women in the highest quintile of total fluid intake compared with women in the lowest quintile was 0.62 (95\% Cl, 0.48 to 0.80). Inclusion of consumption of specific beverages in the multivariate model significantly added to prediction of risk for kidney stones (P {$<$} 0.001). In a multivariate model that adjusted simultaneously for the 17 beverages and other possible risk factors, risk for stone formation decreased by the following amount for each 240-mL (8-oz) serving consumed daily: 10\% (Cl, 5\% to 15\%) for caffeinated coffee, 9\% (CI, 2\% to 15\%) for decaffeinated coffee, 8\% (Cl, 1\% to 15\%) for tea, and 59\% (Cl, 32\% to 75\%) for wine. In contrast, a 44\% (Cl, 9\% to 92\%) increase in risk was seen for each 240-mL serving of grapefruit juice consumed daily. Conclusions: An increase in total fluid intake can reduce risk for kidney stones, and the choice of beverage may be meaningful.},

In addition, the risk associated with different levels of other urinary factors needs clarification. We performed a cross-sectional study of 24-h urine excretion and the risk of kidney stone formation in 3350 men and women, of whom 2237 had a history of nephrolithiasis. After adjusting for other urinary factors, urinary uric acid had a significant inverse association with stone formation in men, a marginal inverse association with risk in younger women, and no association in older women. The risk of stone formation in men and women significantly rose with increasing urine calcium and oxalate, and significantly decreased with increasing citrate and urine volume, with the change in risk beginning below the traditional normal thresholds. Other urinary factors were also associated with risk, but this varied by age and gender. Our study does not support the prevailing belief that higher urine uric acid excretion increases the risk for calcium oxalate stone formation. In addition, the current definitions of normal levels for urinary factors need to be re-evaluated. © 2008 International Society of Nephrology.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Virtual patients provide numerous learning opportunities for medical students, yet only support one-off patient interactions. To emulate general practice, allowing multiple encounters with a single patient, a new longitudinal virtual patient (LVP) was developed. Methods: The LVP was integrated into 2nd year at a graduate-entry medical school, in the 2019/2020 academic year. Students were asked about their prior experience and expectations of LVPs, before they engaged with two consultations and one results session. Data were collected from this survey and from the engagement with the LVP. Feedback was collected and thematically grouped. Results: Survey responses indicated that 1.7\% (2/120) had previous experience with virtual patients, and the majority expected the LVP to make a difference to their clinical reasoning. Out of the 142 students engaged with the LVP, 53\% completed over 75\% of the work. Informal feedback arose around accessibility, professional learning and development, and engagement with the LVP module. Discussion: The data indicate that LVPs are agreeable to medical students, with good engagement and positive reports of clinical learning. Conclusion: Future work exploring reasons of engagement or lack of, will support refinement of the LVP to accommodate the learning needs of the medical students.},

  abstract = {Background: COVID-19 has fundamentally altered how education is delivered. Gordon et~al. previously conducted a review of medical education developments in response to COVID-19; however, the field has rapidly evolved in the ensuing months. This scoping review aims to map the extent, range and nature of subsequent developments, summarizing the expanding evidence base and identifying areas for future research. Methods: The authors followed the five stages of a scoping review outlined by Arskey and O’Malley. Four online databases and MedEdPublish were searched. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Included articles described developments in medical education deployed in response to COVID-19 and reported outcomes. Data extraction was completed by two authors and synthesized into a variety of maps and charts. Results: One hundred twenty-seven articles were included: 104 were from North America, Asia and Europe; 51 were undergraduate, 41 graduate, 22 continuing medical education, and 13 mixed; 35 were implemented by universities, 75 by academic hospitals, and 17 by organizations or collaborations. The focus of developments included pivoting to online learning (n = 58), simulation (n = 24), assessment (n = 11), well-being (n = 8), telehealth (n = 5), clinical service reconfigurations (n = 4), interviews (n = 4), service provision (n = 2), faculty development (n = 2) and other (n = 9). The most common Kirkpatrick outcome reported was Level 1, however, a number of studies reported 2a or 2b. A few described Levels 3, 4a, 4b or other outcomes (e.g. quality improvement). Conclusions: This scoping review mapped the available literature on developments in medical education in response to COVID-19, summarizing developments and outcomes to serve as a guide for future work. The review highlighted areas of relative strength, as well as several gaps. Numerous articles have been written about remote learning and simulation and these areas are ripe for full systematic reviews. Telehealth, interviews and faculty development were lacking and need urgent attention.},

  abstract = {Background: The classical didactic lecture has been the cornerstone of the theoretical undergraduate medical education. Their efficacy however reduces due to reduced interaction and short attention span of the students. It is hypothesized that the interactive response pad obviates some of these drawbacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive response system by comparing it with conventional classroom teaching. Methods: A prospective comparative longitudinal study was conducted on 192 students who were exposed to either conventional or interactive teaching over 20 classes. Pre-test, Posttest and retentions test (post 8e12 weeks) scores were collated and statistically analysed. An independent observer measured number of student interactions in each class. Results: Pre-test scores from both groups were similar (p ¼ 0.71). There was significant improvement in both post test scores when compared to pre-test scores in either method (p {$<$} 0.001). The interactive post-test score was better than conventional post test score (p {$<$} 0.001) by 8e10\% (95\% CI-difference of means e 8.2\%e9.24\%e10.3\%). The interactive retention test score was better than conventional retention test score (p {$<$} 0.001) by 15e18\% (95\% CI-difference of means e 15.0\%e16.64\%e18.2\%). There were 51 participative events in the interactive group vs 25 in the conventional group. Conclusions: The Interactive Response Pad method was efficacious in teaching. Students taught with the interactive method were likely to score 8e10\% higher (statistically significant) in the immediate post class time and 15e18\% higher (statistically significant) after 8 e12 weeks. The number of studenteteacher interactions increases when using the interactive response pads.},

  abstract = {This practical guide for health professions teachers provides a perspective of one of the most important educational developments in the past 30 years. Problem-based learning (PBL) is a continuum of approaches rather than one immutable process. It is a teaching method that can be included in the teacher's tool-kit along with other teaching methods rather than used as the sole educational strategy. PBL reverses the traditional approach to teaching and learning. It starts with individual examples or problem scenarios which stimulate student learning. In so doing, students arrive at general principles and concepts which they then generalize to other situations. PBL has many advantages. It facilitates the acquisition of generic competences, encourages a deep approach to learning and prepares students for the adult learning approach they need for a lifetime of learning in the health care professions. It is also fun. PBL helps in curriculum planning by defining core, ensuring relevance of content, integrating student learning and providing prototype cases. There are also drawbacks associated with PBL. Students may fail to develop an organized framework for their knowledge. The PBL process may inhibit good teachers sharing their enthusiasm for their topic with students and student identification with good teachers. Teachers may not have the skills to facilitate PBL. The problem scenario is of crucial significance. It should engage the students' interest and be skilfully written. While the medium selected for presentation of the scenario is usually print, other media may be used. The clinical tasks carried out by the student may replace the problem scenario as the focus for learning. Students are supported during the PBL process by tutors and/or study guides. The amount of support required is inversely related to the students' prior learning and understanding of the PBL process. A range of additional learning resources and opportunities may be made available to the students, including textbooks, videotapes, computer-based material, lectures and clinical sessions. Tutors require group facilitation skills, an understanding of the PBL process and knowledge of the course and of the curriculum in general. They need special personal qualities and it is preferable if they have expertise in the content area. While special assessment processes have been developed to assess students learning by the PBL method, the general principles of assessment apply to PBL courses and a mixed menu of assessment methods needs to be employed. Curriculum design involves a skilful blend of educational strategies designed to help students achieve the curriculum outcomes. PBL may make a valuable contribution to this blend but attention needs to be paid to how it is implemented.},

Results show tutor tasks appeared to be comparable in both settings with regard to “content and pedagogical content knowledge,” “group dynamics,” “process instruction” and “intermediary between faculty and students.” The face-to-face group rated tutor performance lower than the online students. Students and tutor identified the absence of nonverbal cues as a limitation of online PBL. In online sessions the tutor additionally provided technical support and moderated the chat box. It is recommended to involve an extra person in online sessions who is responsible for technical issues. This person could also check the chat box for messages of students.

  abstract = {This paper presents a case study on the adoption and the impact of new modules in a learning analytics dashboard supporting the dialogue between student advisors and students when advising on a study plan for the next academic semester in Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral, a higher education institute in Ecuador. The impact and the adoption of the new dashboard modules were assessed using a mixed‐methods approach. The                 quantitative approach                 builds on data of 172 advisors in 34 programs and 4481 advising sessions in 2019 (post) and 4747 advising sessions in 2018 (pre) to assess the adoption and use of the dashboard, the level of support experienced by the advisors, the impact of the new dashboard modules on the difference between the advised study plan and the plan students register for, and students’ academic achievement. The                 qualitative approach                 with observations of 14 staged advising dialogues and semi‐structured interviews with eight advisors was used to assess how the dashboard was used and to get deeper understanding of the perceived usefulness and impact of the dashboard. The results show that an institution‐wide deployment of dashboard modules tailored to the needs of the advisors can be achieved and can increase the level of support perceived by the advisors and significantly decrease the gap between the suggested study plans in advising dialogues and the study plans that students actually register for. On the short‐term, however, no significant changes in academic achievement were observed.

What this paper adds?                                                                     This paper adds, to the scarce scientific evidence on academic advising dashboards, a large‐scale case study on a dashboard supporting the advisor student dialogue during the composition of well‐balanced study plans.                                                                       The paper presents research evidence of the impact of the dashboard on the support advisors experience, the study plans suggested by the advisors and the ones actually registered by the students and students’ academic achievement. Evidence is based on a quantitative analysis, using data of 172 advisors from 34 programs representing more than 9000 advising dialogues, and a qualitative analysis using observations and interviews.                                                                                                       Implications for practice and/or policy                                                                     Dashboards to support academic advising dialogues can be realized institution‐wide at scale. Training of student advisors supports a large scale deployment.                                                                       Well‐designed dashboards that focus on addressing needs of advisors increase the level of support that advisor experience when advising students.                                                                       Dashboard accommodating the simulation of study plans and the workload associated with them, succeed in decreasing the variance in suggested plans between advisors and reduce the gap between the study plans that advisors suggest to student and the study plans that students actually register for. Short‐term impact on academic achievement was not observed.},

  abstract = {Background: The relationship between the composition and function of gut microbial communities and early-onset calcium oxalate kidney stone disease is unknown. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of 88 individuals aged 4-18 years, which included 44 individuals with kidney stones containing ≥50\% calcium oxalate and 44 controls matched for age, sex, and race. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed on stool samples. Results Participants who were kidney stone formers had a significantly less diverse gut microbiome compared with controls. Among bacterial taxa with a prevalence {$>$}0.1\%, 31 taxa were less abundant among individuals with nephrolithiasis. These included seven taxa that produce butyrate and three taxa that degrade oxalate. The lower abundance of these bacteria was reflected in decreased abundance of the gene encoding butyryl-coA dehydrogenase (P=0.02). The relative abundance of these bacteria was correlated with the levels of 18 fecal metabolites, and levels of these metabolites differed in individuals with kidney stones compared with controls. The oxalate-degrading bacterial taxa identified as decreased in those who were kidney stone formers were components of a larger abundance correlation network that included Eggerthella lenta and several Lactobacillus species. The microbial (a) diversity was associated with age of stone onset, first decreasing and then increasing with age. For the individuals who were stone formers, we found the lowest a diversity among individuals who first formed stones at age 9-14 years, whereas controls displayed no age-related differences in diversity. Conclusions Loss of gut bacteria, particularly loss of those that produce butyrate and degrade oxalate, associates with perturbations of the metabolome that may be upstream determinants of early-onset calcium oxalate kidney stone disease.},

  abstract = {Background: High sodium intake is known to increase blood pressure and is difficult to measure in epidemiologic studies. Objective: We examined the effect of sodium intake on metabolites within the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial)–Sodium Trial to further our understanding of the biological effects of sodium intake beyond blood pressure. Design: The DASH-Sodium Trial randomly assigned individuals to either the DASH diet (low in fat and high in protein, low-fat dairy, and fruits and vegetables) or a control diet for 12 wk. Participants within each diet arm received, in random order, diets containing high (150 nmol or 3450 mg), medium (100 nmol or 2300 mg), and low (50 nmol or 1150 mg) amounts of sodium for 30 d (crossover design). Fasting blood samples were collected at the end of each sodium intervention. We measured 531 identified plasma metabolites in 73 participants at the end of their high- and low-sodium interventions and in 46 participants at the end of their high- and medium-sodium interventions (N = 119). We used linear mixed-effects regression to model the relation between each log-transformed metabolite and sodium intake. We also combined the resulting P values with Fisher’s method to estimate the association between sodium intake and 38 metabolic pathways or groups. Results: Six pathways were associated with sodium intake at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.0013 (e.g., fatty acid, food component or plant, benzoate, g-glutamyl amino acid, methionine, and tryptophan). Although 82 metabolites were associated with sodium intake at a false discovery rate \#0.10, only 4-ethylphenylsufate, a xenobiotic related to benzoate metabolism, was significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P, 1025). Adjustment for coinciding change in blood pressure did not substantively alter the association for the top-ranked metabolites. Conclusion: Sodium intake is associated with changes in circulating metabolites, including gut microbial, tryptophan, plant component, and g-glutamyl amino acid–related metabolites. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000608.},

Despite increasing popularity in classroom settings, the application of these devices to health education programming has not been studied. We assessed feasibility, engagement, and learning among children using an ARS compared with traditional pencil-paper formats, (ARS) for a stroke health education program. METHOD: We compared outcome data generated via an ARS-based intervention to pencil-paper controls, including test scores and missing data rates among 265 schoolchildren 9 to 11 years old participating in stroke education. Among 119 children, we evaluated the feasibility of ARS use and explored student motivation with a 10-item questionnaire. We assessed facilitator experience with both methods. RESULTS: ARS use is feasible. Students reported having more fun (p {$<$} .001), increased attention (p {$<$} .001), participation (p {$<$} .001), and perceived learning outcomes (p {$<$} .001) compared with pencil-paper controls. Test scores showed highly positive improvement for both ARS and paper without additional benefits of ARS on learning. There was no difference in missing data rates (p {$<$} .001). Educators preferred the ARS. CONCLUSION: The use of an ARS among children is feasible and improves student and facilitator engagement without additional benefits on stroke learning.},

  abstract = {In view of the current situation with a worldwide pandemic, the use of online teaching has become critical. This is difficult in the context of human anatomy, a subject contingent primarily on the use of human cadaveric tissues for learning through face-to-face practical laboratory sessions. Although anatomy has been taught using online resources including 3D models and anatomy applications, feedback from students and academic staff does not support the replacement of face-to-face teaching. At Charles Sturt University, we were obligated to cancel all classes on-campus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We ran exclusive online anatomy practical classes replacing classes usually run on campus. We designed an alternative program that consisted of twenty pre-recorded videos that were prepared in the anatomy laboratory using cadaveric tissues, and then discussed in live (and interactive) tutorials. Furthermore, innovative approaches to learning were shown and encouraged by the lecturer. Student survey responses indicated a positive response to both the anatomical videos and the innovative learning approaches. The results obtained by students showed a statistically significant increase in high distinctions and marked decrease in the amount of fail grades, compared with the previous three years (not online). The use of these videos and the encouragement of innovative learning approaches was a novel experience that will add valuable experiences for improved practice in online anatomy teaching. We propose that online anatomy videos of cadavers combined with innovative approaches are an efficient and engaging approach to replace face-to-face anatomy teaching under the current contexts.},

  abstract = {Obesity is associated with a higher risk of advanced prostate cancer, but men with the same body mass index (BMI) may differ in their underlying metabolic health. Using metabolomics data from nested case-control studies in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we calculated Pearson correlations between 165 circulating metabolites and three adiposity measures (BMI, waist circumference, and derived fat mass from a validated prediction equation) to identify adiposity-associated metabolites. We used Lasso to further select metabolites for prediction models of adiposity measures, which we used to calculate metabolic scores representing metabolic obesity. In an independent set of 212 advanced prostate cancer cases (T3b/T4/N1/M1 or lethal during follow-up) and 212 controls, we used logistic regression to evaluate the associations between adiposity measures and metabolic scores with risk of advanced disease. All adiposity measures were associated with higher blood levels of carnitines (Pearson r range, 0.16 to 0.18) and lower levels of glutamine (r = −0.19) and glycine (r, −0.29 to −0.20), in addition to alterations in various lipids. No adiposity measure or metabolic score was associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer (e.g., odds ratio for a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.73, 1.27) and BMI metabolic score 1.18 (95\% CI: 0.57, 2.48)). BMI, waist circumference, and derived fat mass were associated with a broad range of metabolic alterations. Neither adiposity nor metabolic scores were associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fasting plasma lipid profiles were measured in a case-control study of 540 nephrolithiasis cases and 656 kidney stone-free controls. RESULTS: Triglycerides (TG) levels were significantly higher, but total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly lower in nephrolithiasis patients than those in the control group (each p {$<$} 0.05). Similar associations were found in both primary and recurrent nephrolithiasis patients except for TC levels. Significantly lower TC and LDL-C levels were found in all patients except those with uric acid stones. Patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) and uric acid stones had significantly higher TG levels. Individuals with hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterolemia were associated with increased risk of nephrolithiasis (OR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.01-1.71 and OR 7.57, 95\% CI 5.64-10.17, respectively). Conversely, those with hypercholesterolemia and high LDL-cholesterolemia were associated with decreased nephrolithiasis risk (OR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.46-0.79 and OR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.42-0.90, respectively). The risk remained in patients with CaOx stones. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dyslipidemia was associated with nephrolithiasis risk in a Chinese population, especially in patients with CaOx stones.},

How do both approaches fit with current design principles? How might PBL and TBL benefit from each other's unique strengths? Methods: Analysis of the literature. Results: The overall similarities beten PBL and TBL relate to the use of professionally relevant problems and small group learning, both fitting ll with current instructional design principles. The main difference is that one teacher in TBL can run tnty or even more study teams, whereas in PBL each small group is run by one teacher. Conclusion: In this paper advocate for a joining of forces. By combining elements of PBL and TBL, could create varied instructional approaches that are in keeping with current instructional design principles, thereby combining the best of both worlds to optimize student learning.},

  abstract = {The impact of the Covid‐19 pandemic has presented challenges in medical education particularly, with development of online learning in a short time period. Notably there has been a significant increase in the use of digital technology applications to meet this challenge. For instance, in the first quarter of 2020 the game‐based software Kahoot! reported a threefold increase in players and a fivefold increase in asynchronous learning globally. However, there is limited research into the use of game‐based digital technology applications such as Kahoot! and the associated learning theories, particularly in histology, anatomy, and medical education. This scoping review explored the utilization, outcome scores, and student perceptions of learning with the application of Kahoot! in histology, anatomy, and medical education. Online databases were used to identify articles published between 2013 and 2021 from which 12 articles were included in the review. The majority of articles supported positive student outcomes including improved collaborative learning, improved knowledge of content, attendance, and participation. Minor negative aspects included increased time on task, overwhelming learning content, and distractions due to gadgets. None of the articles included a control group. The main educational theories identified were active learning followed by social and constructivism learning theory. In light of the Covid‐19 pandemic a rapid and fundamental shift in how digital applications are being used in educational institutions has evolved. Further research on learning frameworks and studies with control groups is required to evaluate Kahoot! as a potentially valuable online application in histology, anatomy, and medical education.},

  abstract = {In this review of the application of proteomics and metabolomics to kidney disease research, we review key concepts, highlight illustrative examples, and outline future directions. The proteome and metabolome reflect the influence of environmental exposures in addition to genetic coding. Circulating levels of proteins and metabolites are dynamic and modifiable, and thus amenable to therapeutic targeting. Design and analytic considerations in proteomics and metabolomics studies should be tailored to the investigator's goals. For the identification of clinical biomarkers, adjustment for all potential confounding variables, particularly GFR, and strict significance thresholds are warranted. However, this approach has the potential to obscure biologic signals and can be overly conservative given the high degree of intercorrelation within the proteome and metabolome. Mass spectrometry, often coupled to up-front chromatographic separation techniques, is a major workhorse in both proteomics and metabolomics. High-throughput antibody- and aptamer-based proteomic platforms have emerged as additional, powerful approaches to assay the proteome. As the breadth of coverage for these methodologies continues to expand, machine learning tools and pathway analyses can help select the molecules of greatest interest and categorize them in distinct biologic themes. Studies to date have already made a substantial effect, for example elucidating target antigens in membranous nephropathy, identifying a signature of urinary peptides that adds prognostic information to urinary albumin in CKD, implicating circulating inflammatory proteins as potential mediators of diabetic nephropathy, demonstrating the key role of the microbiome in the uremic milieu, and highlighting kidney bioenergetics as a modifiable factor in AKI. Additional studies are required to replicate and expand on these findings in independent cohorts. Further, more work is needed to understand the longitudinal trajectory of select protein and metabolite markers, perform transomics analyses within merged datasets, and incorporate more kidney tissue-based investigation.},

There is a national call for medical educators to develop clinical reasoning curricula in undergraduate medical education. To address this need, we developed a longitudinal clinical reasoning curriculum for internal medicine clerkship students. Methods: We delivered six 1-hour sessions to approximately 40 students over the 15-week combined medicine-surgery clerkship at Penn State College of Medicine. We developed the content using previous work in clinical reasoning, including the American College of Physicians' Teaching Medicine Series book Teaching Clinical Reasoning. Students applied a clinical reasoning diagnostic framework to written cases during each workshop. Each session followed a scaffold approach and built upon previously learned clinical reasoning skills. We administered a pre- and postsurvey to assess students' baseline knowledge of clinical reasoning concepts and perceived confidence in performing clinical reasoning skills. Students also provided open-ended responses regarding the effectiveness of the curriculum. Results: The curriculum was well received by students and led to increased perceived knowledge of clinical reasoning concepts and increased confidence in applying clinical reasoning skills. Students commented on the usefulness of practicing clinical reasoning in a controlled environment while utilizing a framework that could be deliberately applied to patient care. Discussion: The longitudinal clinical reasoning curriculum was effective in reinforcing key concepts of clinical reasoning and allowed for deliberate practice in a controlled environment. The curriculum is generalizable to students in both the preclinical and clinical years.},

These may include students' beliefs about themselves, their feelings about school, or their habits of self-control. The research reviewed in this paper shows that educational interventions and initiatives that target these psychological factors can transform students' experience and achievement in school, improving core academic outcomes such as GPA and test scores months and even years later.

Previous investigations suggest that students' use of an EVS would be positively associated with their learning outcomes. However, no research has established this relationship empirically. This study sought to establish whether there was an association between students' use of an EVS over one semester and their performance in the subject's assessment tasks. The results from two stages of analysis are broadly consistent in showing a positive association between EVS usage and learning outcomes for students who are, relative to their class, more correct in their EVS responses. Potential explanations for this finding are discussed as well as modifications and future directions of this program of research.},

Methods: We performed a nested case-control study of rapid CKD progression in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, profiling baseline plasma from 200 individuals each with eGFR slope {$<$}-3 ml/min/1.73 m{$<$}ovid:sup{$>$}2{$<$}/ovid:sup{$>$}/year (cases) or between-1 and +1 ml/min/1.73 m{$<$}ovid:sup{$>$}2{$<$}/ovid:sup{$>$}/year (controls), matched on baseline eGFR and proteinuria. To directly assess how the kidney modulates circulating metabolites, we profiled plasma from the aorta and renal vein of 25 hospital-based individuals. Results: At baseline, cases and controls had a mean eGFR of 41.7 +/- 13.3 and 45.0 +/- 14.5 ml/min/1.73 m{$<$}ovid:sup{$>$}2{$<$}/ovid:sup{$>$}, respectively. Ten plasma metabolites were nominally associated with CKD progression in logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes, eGFR and proteinuria; no metabolite achieved the Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold (p {$<$} 0.0003). In a cross-sectional analysis, all 6 of the metabolites that were higher in cases than controls were significantly associated with eGFR at baseline. By contrast, threonine, methionine and arginine were lower in cases than in controls and had no association with baseline eGFR. Furthermore, in the hospital-based cohort that underwent renal arteriovenous sampling, these 3 metabolites were net released from the kidney. Combining these metabolites into a panel of markers further strengthened their association with CKD progression. Conclusion: Our results motivate interest in arginine, methionine and threonine as potential indicators of renal metabolic function and markers of renal prognosis. Copyright \&\#xa9; 2016 S.

The use of dietary biomarkers may improve the accuracy of estimates. Objective: We applied a metabolomic approach in a large cohort study to identify novel biomarkers of intake for a selection of polyphenolcontaining foods. The large chemical diversity of polyphenols and their wide distribution over many foods make them ideal biomarker candidates for such foods. Design: Metabolic profiles were measured with the use of highresolution mass spectrometry in 24-h urine samples from 481 subjects from the large European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Peak intensities were correlated to acute and habitual dietary intakes of 6 polyphenol-rich foods (coffee, tea, red wine, citrus fruit, apples and pears, and chocolate products) measured with the use of 24-h dietary recalls and food-frequency questionnaires, respectively. Results: Correlation (r {$<$} 0.3, P {$>$} 0.01 after correction for multiple testing) and discriminant [pcorr (1) {$<$} 0.3, VIP {$<$} 1.5] analyses showed that .2000 mass spectral features from urine metabolic profiles were significantly associated with the consumption of the 6 selected foods. More than 80 polyphenol metabolites associated with the consumption of the selected foods could be identified, and large differences in their concentrations reflecting individual food intakes were observed within and between 4 European countries. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that 5 polyphenol metabolites, which are characteristic of 5 of the 6 selected foods, had a high predicting ability of food intake. Conclusion: Highly diverse food-derived metabolites (the so-called food metabolome) can be characterized in human biospecimens through this powerful metabolomic approach and screened to identify novel biomarkers for dietary exposures, which are ultimately essential to better understand the role of the diet in the cause of chronic diseases.},

Effective learning requires active student participation which is problematic when teaching large groups of students. New technologies, such as the Audience Response System (ARS), have been introduced to increase student participation and support them in the understanding of complex bioscience concepts.Within one university department, an evaluation was undertaken to identify the perceptions of pre-registration nurse students on the use of ARS in the teaching and learning of bioscience. Our findings concur with others that ARS increases student participation and aids in identifying misconceptions and in correcting them. Students found ARS very useful and wanted ARS to be used in additional modules too. Although ARS did not seem to motivate students to study adequately before attending the relevant sessions, it increased discussion among students and awareness of their level of knowledge compared to their peers. Further research is required to identify the effectiveness of ARS in the teaching and learning of bioscience and its impact on the performance of the students in their final assessments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  title = {A {{Taxonomy}} of {{Community-based Medical Education}}},
  author = {Eldin, Mohi and Magzoub, M A and Schmidt, Henk G},
  abstract = {The authors propose a classification of community-based education (CBE) as it is implemented all over the world. To create this taxonomy, they used reports in the literature of 31 active programs in many locations. A CBE program is an instructional program carried out in a community context, outside the academic hospital. The authors distinguish between programs that are developed primarily to provide services to an underserved community ; programs that have a research focus; and programs that have as their primary goal the (clinical) training of students. These three major types can be subdivided in six minor types, among them community development programs, health intervention programs, and simple community exposure programs. The ultimate goal of creating the taxonomy is to contribute to the development of a theory of CBE and provide a more systematic way to study CBE. In addition, the proposed taxonomy clearly demonstrates the various ways in which medical schools, their staffs, and their students can become involved with the communities served. CBE is not a unitary concept but a set of attempts to contribute to the quality of life in a particular community and, at the same time, create conditions for students to acquire hands-on understanding of the nature of the problems to be faced in future professional practice, and to develop relevant skills. The taxonomy also enables those involved in the development of CBE programs in their medical schools to see alternative approaches, which will help them choose the approaches that fit their particular educational goals. Last, it demonstrates the intricacies involved in the implementation of CBE, in particular the complexity of building a learning environment that is productive for students and, at the same time, responsive to community needs. Acad. Med. 2000;75:699-707. C ommunity-based education is now recognized as an important addition to the methods available in medical education, because the skills of graduates are needed in the community more than in the tertiary hospital. Unfortunately, medical education as it is practiced in most educational institutions for the health professions is quite skewed toward the cure of individuals in tertiary health care, whose problems represent only the tip of the iceberg of the prevailing community health problems. focuses on both population groups and individuals and that takes into account the health needs of the community concerned. 1 Community-based education, however, is a means of achieving educational relevance to community needs and, consequently, serves as a way of implementing a community-oriented education program. It consists of learning activities that utilize the community extensively as a learning environment in which not only students, but also teachers, members of the community, and representatives of other sectors are actively involved throughout the educational experience. 2 The distinction between community-oriented and community based education is not very clear, even for institutions involved in both. Therefore, we offer the following suggestion for a distinction: Community orientation refers to the objectives of the school and their relevance to community health needs. These objectives are reflected in the content of the curriculum. This means that the subject matter studied by the students has direct relevance with regard to the priority health problems of the society for which these stu},

  abstract = {Many researchers have called for implementation of active learning practices in undergraduate science classrooms as one method to increase retention and persistence in STEM, yet there has been little research on the potential increases in student anxiety that may accompany these practices. This is of concern because excessive anxiety can decrease student performance. Levels and sources of student anxiety in three introductory biology lecture classes were investigated via an online survey and student interviews. The survey (n = 327) data revealed that 16\% of students had moderately high classroom anxiety, which differed among the three classes. All five active learning classroom practices that were investigated caused student anxiety, with students voluntarily answering a question or being called on to answer a question causing higher anxiety than working in groups, completing worksheets, or answering clicker questions. Interviews revealed that student anxiety seemed to align with communication apprehension, social anxiety, and test anxiety. Additionally, students with higher general anxiety were more likely to self-report lower course grade and the intention to leave the major. These data suggest that a subset of students in introductory biology experience anxiety in response to active learning, and its potential impacts should be investigated.},

  abstract = {The paradigm shift to competency-based medical education (CBME) is under way, but incomplete implementation is blunting the potential impact on learning and patient outcomes. The fundamental principles of CBME call for standardizing outcomes addressing population health needs, then allowing time-variable progression to achieving them. Operationalizing CBME principles requires continuity within and across phases of the education, training, and practice continuum. However, the piecemeal origin of the phases of the “continuum” has resulted in a sequence of undergraduate to graduate medical education to practice that may be continuous temporally but bears none of the integration of a true continuum.             With these timed interruptions during phase transitions, learning is not reinforced because of a failure to integrate experiences. Brief block rotations for learners and ever-shorter supervisory assignments for faculty preclude the development of relationships. Without these relationships, feedback falls on deaf ears. Block rotations also disrupt learners’ relationships with patients. The harms resulting from such a system include decreases in patient satisfaction with their care and learner satisfaction with their work. Learners in this block system also demonstrate an erosion of empathy compared with those in innovative longitudinal training models. In addition, higher patient mortality during intern transitions has been demonstrated.             The current medical education system is violating the first principle of medicine: “Do no harm.” Full implementation of competency-based, time-variable education and training, with fixed outcomes aligned with population health needs, continuity in learning and relationships, and support from a developmental program of assessment, holds great potential to stop this harm.},

  abstract = {In this report we review the range of teaching resources and strategies used in anatomy education with the aim of coming up with suggestions about the best teaching practices in this area. There is much debate about suitable methods of delivering anatomical knowledge. Competent clinicians, particularly surgeons, need a deep understanding of anatomy for safe clinical procedures. However, because students have had very limited exposure to anatomy during clinical training, there is a concern that medical students are ill-prepared in anatomy when entering clerkships and residency programs. Therefore, developing effective modalities for teaching anatomy is essential to safe medical practice. Cadaver-based instruction has survived as the main instructional tool for hundreds of years, however, there are differing views on whether full cadaver dissection is still appropriate for a modern undergraduate training. The limitations on curricular time, trained anatomy faculty and resources for gross anatomy courses in integrated or/and system-based curricula, have led many medical schools to abandon costly and time-consuming dissection-based instruction in favour of alternative methods of instruction including prosection, medical imaging, living anatomy and multimedia resources. To date, no single teaching tool has been found to meet curriculum requirements. The best way to teach modern anatomy is by combining multiple pedagogical resources to complement one another, students appear to learn more effectively when multimodal and system-based approaches are integrated. Our review suggests that certain professions would have more benefit from certain educational methods or strategies than others. Full body dissection would be best reserved for medical students, especially those with surgical career intentions, while teaching based on prosections and plastination is more suitable for dental, pharmacy and allied health science students. There is a need to direct future research towards evaluation of the suitability of the new teaching methodologies in new curricula and student perceptions of integrated and multimodal teaching paradigms, and the ability of these to satisfy learning outcomes.},

The tips are provided chronologically, offering guidance regarding how one might conceptualize their goals for creating an MMI, how to establish a database of stations that are context appropriate, and how to prepare both candidates and examiners for their task. While MMIs have been shown to have utility in many instances, the authors urge caution against over-generalization by stressing the importance of post-MMI considerations including data monitoring and integration between one's admissions philosophy and one's curricular efforts.},

This study examines relationships of course performance vs. VARK learning preference, study time, and career plan among students enrolled in an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course at a large urban university. Students (n\,=\,492) from the fall semester course completed a survey consisting of the VARK questionnaire, gender, academic year, career plans, and estimated hours spent per week in combined classroom and study time. Seventy-eight percent of students reported spending 15 or fewer hours per week studying. Study time and overall course score correlated significantly for the class as a whole (r\,=\,0.111, P\,=\,0.013), which was mainly due to lecture (r\,=\,0.118, P\,=\,0.009) performance. No significant differences were found among students grouped by learning styles. When corrected for academic year, overall course scores (mean\,±\,SEM) for students planning to enter dentistry, medicine, optometry or pharmacy (79.89\,±\,0.88\%) were significantly higher than those of students planning to enter physical or occupational therapies (74.53\,±\,1.15\%; P\,=\,0.033), as well as nurse/physician assistant programs (73.60\,±\,1.3\%; P\,=\,0.040). Time spent studying was not significantly associated with either learning style or career choice. Our findings suggest that specific career goals and study time, not learning preferences, are associated with better performance among a diverse group of students in an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course. However, the extent to which prior academic preparation, cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors influenced these results requires further investigation.

  abstract = {Context: The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in clinical care is growing rapidly and advocates have recently proposed the integration of ultrasound into undergraduate medical education (UME). The evidentiary basis for this integration has not been evaluated critically or systematically. Objectives: We conducted a critical and systematic review framed by the rationales enumerated in academic publications by advocates of ultrasound in UME. Methods: This research was conducted in two phases. First, the dominant discursive rationales for the integration of ultrasound in UME were identified from an archive of 403 academic publications using techniques from Foucauldian critical discourse analysis (CDA). We then sought empirical evidence in support of these rationales, using a critical synthesis methodology also adapted from CDA. Results: We identified four dominant discursive rationales with different levels of evidentiary support. The use of ultrasound was not demonstrated to improve students' understanding of anatomy. The benefit of ultrasound in teaching physical examination was inconsistent and rests on minimal evidence. With POCUS, students' diagnostic accuracy was improved for certain pathologies, but findings were inconsistent for others. Finally, the rationale that ultrasound training in UME will improve the quality of patient care was difficult to evaluate. Conclusions: Our analysis has shown that the frequently repeated rationales for the integration of ultrasound in UME are not supported by a sufficient base of empirical research. The repetition of these dominant discursive rationales in academic publications legitimises them and may preclude further primary research. As the value of clinical ultrasound use by medical students remains unproven, educators must consider whether the associated financial and temporal costs are justified or whether more research is required.},

  abstract = {Context: In recent years, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become a widely used clinical tool in a number of clinical specialties. In response, POCUS has been incorporated into medical curricula across the learning continuum, bolstered by enthusiastic appraisals of the technology's benefits for learners, clinicians and patients. In this project, we have sought to identify and understand the effects of dominant discourses influencing the integration of POCUS into medical education. Methods: We conducted a Foucauldian critical discourse analysis (CDA) to identify and analyse discourses that legitimise and privilege the use of POCUS in medical education. We assembled an archive of 473 texts published between 1980 and 2017. Each article in the archive was analysed to identify frequently occurring truth statements (expressing concepts whose truths are unquestioned within particular discourses) that we used to characterise the major discourses that construct representations of POCUS in medical education. Results: We identified three dominant discourses: (i) a visuo-centric discourse prioritising the visual information as truth over other clinical data; (ii) a utilitarian discourse emphasising improvements in patient care; and (iii) a modernist discourse highlighting the current and future needs of clinicians in our technological world. These discourses overlap and converge; the core discursive effect makes the further elevation of POCUS in medical education, and the resulting attenuation of other curricular priorities, appear inevitable. Conclusions: The three dominant discourses identified in this paper engender ideal conditions for the proliferation of POCUS in medical education through curricular guidelines, surveys of adherence to these guidelines and authoritative position statements. By identifying and analysing these dominant discourses, we can ask questions that do not take for granted the assumed truths underpinning the discourses, highlight potential pitfalls of proposed curricular changes and ensure these changes truly improve medical education.},

Method The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing knowledge retention among learners who registered for an annual CPD conference at the University of Toronto in April 2016. Participants were randomized to receive an online preworkshop stand-alone MCQ test (no feedback) and a postworkshop MCQ test (with feedback) after a 14- day delay. Controls received no pre-/ posttesting. The primary outcome measure was performance on a clinical vignette-based retention and application test delivered to all participants four weeks post conference. Secondary outcomes included self-reported changes in learning behavior, satisfaction, and efficiency of TEL. Results Three hundred eight physicians from across Canada registered for the four-day conference; 186 physicians consented to participate in the study and were randomized to receive TEL or to the control group in 1 of 15 workshops, with 126 providing complete data. A random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated a pooled effect size indicating moderate effect of TEL (Hedges g of 0.46; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.67). The majority of respondents (65\%) reported improved CPD learning resulting from pretesting. Conclusions Testing for learning can be leveraged to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for CPD. Testing remains an underused education intervention in CPD, and the use of formative assessment to enhance professional development should be a key target for research.},

Results: The analysis included 21 RCTs with 2168 participants over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range 0.5–9.7). The median recurrence of kidney stones was 15 per 100 person–years (range 0–110). Recurrence was higher in those with two or more previous stone episodes compared to those with a single episode at enrolment (16 vs. 6 per 100 person–years, p {$<$} 0.001) and in those untreated or treated with dietary changes compared to those treated with drugs (26 vs. 23 vs. 9 per 100 person–years, p {$<$} 0.001). The effect of drugs on recurrence seemed to be beneficial only among those with two or more previous stone episodes. Conclusions: The overall recurrence rate of stones depends on factors such as previous stone history and type of treatment. Dietary approaches seem to be more effective among single stone formers, whereas drugs seem to be more effective among recurrent stone formers.},

  abstract = {Rationale \& Objective: The intestinal microbiome may affect urinary stone disease by modulating the amount of oxalate absorbed from the intestine and subsequently excreted in urine. This study sought to explore the association between antibiotics, which alter the intestinal microbiota, and risk for urinary stone disease. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting \& Participants: 5,010 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) I and II who had collected 24-hour urine samples. Exposures: Use of antibiotics during the age range of 40 to 49 (NHS II), 40 to 59 (NHS I), and 20 to 39 years (both cohorts). Outcomes: Incident symptomatic urinary stone disease; urine composition. Analytical Approach: Cause-specific hazards regression adjusted for age, body mass index, comorbid conditions, thiazide use, and dietary factors. Follow-up was censored at the time of asymptomatic kidney stones, cancer, or death. Results: Cumulative use of antibiotics for a total of 2 or more months during the age range of 40 to 49 years (NHS II) and 40 to 59 years (NHS II) was associated with significantly higher risk for developing incident stones compared with no use (pooled HR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.96). Similar results were found for the period of 20 to 39 years (pooled HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.84). Results were unchanged after excluding participants who reported urinary tract infection with their stone event or as the most common reason for antibiotic use. Urine composition was generally similar across antibiotic groups except for marginally lower urine pH and citrate values among those taking antibiotics for 2 or more months. Limitations: Observational design; lack of information for type of antibiotic used; relatively large span of time between antibiotic use and urine collection. Conclusions: Use of antibiotics for more than 2 months in early adulthood and middle age is associated with higher risk for urinary stone disease in later life.},

  abstract = {Backgrounds: Research concerning student-centered learning (SCL) recommends a comprehensive assessment of medical students’ competencies including their personal and professional characters. Accordingly, nurturing future doctors should be in a continuous mentorship program. However, in a hierarchical culture, communication is oneway with limited feedback and reflection. We aimed to explore challenges and opportunities for SCL implementation in medical schools in this cultural setting necessary for a globally interdependent world. Methods: Two cycles of participatory action research (PAR) were conducted, involving medical students and teachers in Indonesia. A national conference on SCL principles was conducted between the cycles, also the SCL modules were developed for each institution and feedback was shared. Twelve focus group discussions were conducted (before and after the module development), with 37 medical teachers and 48 medical students from 7 faculties of medicine across Indonesia at various levels accreditation. Following verbatim transcriptions, a thematic analysis was conducted. Results and Discussions: In cycle 1 PAR, some challenges in implementing SCL were identified: lack of constructive feedback, overloaded content, summative-based assessment, hierarchical culture environment, and teachers’ dilemma of committed time between patientcare and education. In cycle 2, several opportunities to approach the SCL were proposed: a faculty development program on mentorship, students’ reflection guides and training, a more longitudinal assessment system, also a more supportive government policy on the human resources system. Conclusions: The main challenge of fostering student-centered learning revealed in this study was a teacher-centered learning tendency in the medical curriculum. The weighting towards summative assessment and the national educational policy drive the curriculum like a ‘domino effect’, away from the expected student-centered learning principles. However, using a participative method, students and teachers could identify opportunities and articu­ late their educational needs, i.e., a partnership-mentorship program, as a significant step toward student-centered learning in this cultural context.},

Second, with relative consistency, students reported avoiding competitive situations where they did not believe chances were good that they would win. Conversely, they tended to involve themselves in situations where success was perceived as possible or likely. Third, gender differences existed in how the students viewed competition.

The results from the analysis show that the Rasch model fits the majority of the VARK questionnaire data and the sample data support the internal validity of the four sub-constructs at 1\% level of significance for all but one item. While this suggests that the instrument could potentially be used as a predictor for a person's learning preference orientation, further analysis is necessary to confirm the invariability of the instrument across different user groups across factors such as gender, age, educational and cultural background.}

  abstract = {Postgraduate medical education is an essential societal enterprise that prepares highly skilled physicians for the health workforce. In recent years, PGME systems have been criticized worldwide for problems with variable graduate abilities, concerns about patient safety, and issues with teaching and assessment methods. In response, competency based medical education approaches, with an emphasis on graduate outcomes, have been proposed as the direction for 21st century health profession education. However, there are few published models of large-scale implementation of these approaches. We describe the rationale and design for a national, time-variable competency-based multi-specialty system for postgraduate medical education called Competence by Design. Fourteen innovations were bundled to create this new system, using the Van Melle Core Components of competency based medical education as the basis for the transformation. The successful execution of this transformational training system shows competency based medical education can be implemented at scale. The lessons learned in the early implementation of Competence by Design can inform competency based medical education innovation efforts across professions worldwide.},

  abstract = {Background: Acquiring medical knowledge is a key competency for medical students and a~lifelong requirement for physicians. Learning techniques can improve academic success and help students cope with stressors. To support students’ learning process medical faculties should know about learning techniques. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferred learning techniques of female and male as well as junior and senior medical students and how these learning techniques are related to perceived learning difficulties. Methods: In 2019, we conducted an online survey with students of the undergraduate, competency-based curriculum of medicine at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. We chose ten learning techniques of high, moderate and low utility according to Dunlosky et al. (2013) and we asked medical students to rate their preferred usage of those techniques using a 5-point Likert scale. We applied t-tests to show differences in usage between female and male as well as junior and senior learners. Additionally, we conducted a multiple regression analysis to explore the predictive power of learning techniques regarding perceived difficulties. Results: A total of 730 medical students (488 women, 242 men, Mage = 24.85, SD = 4.49) use three techniques the most: ‘highlighting’ (low utility), ‘self-explanation’ (moderate utility) and ‘practice testing’ (high utility). Female students showed a significantly higher usage of low-utility learning techniques (t(404.24) = -7.13, p {$<$}.001) and a higher usage of high-utility learning techniques (t(728) = -2.50, p {$<$}.05) than male students (M = 3.55, SD =.95). Compared to junior students (second to sixth semester; M = 3.65, SD =.71), senior students (seventh semester to final clerkship year; M = 3.52, SD =.73) showed a lower use of low-utility learning techniques (t(603) = 2.15, p {$<$}.05). Usage of low-utility techniques is related to more difficulties (β =.08, t(724) = 2.13, p {$<$}.05). Usage of moderate-utility techniques is related to less learning difficulties (β = -.13, t(599) = -3.21, p {$<$}.01). Conclusions: Students use a wide range of low-, moderate- and high-utility learning techniques. The use of learning techniques has an influence on the difficulties perceived by students. Therefore, they could benefit from knowing about and using high-utility learning techniques to facilitate their learning. Faculties should inform their students about effective learning and introduce them to useful learning techniques.},

  abstract = {Academics today face an array of challenges to their enthusiasm, including teaching students from diverse backgrounds with wavering levels of engagement with their studies. Furthermore, reform to the tertiary education sector has seen the corporatisation of universities with management increasingly measuring academic outcomes in respect of both teaching and research. This is proving to be problematic, particularly in measuring and recognising good teaching. With these select measurements, academics can feel that a substantial part of their work is not recognised in a meaningful way, which may impact morale, intellectual time and autonomy. This limited recognition can result in academics' enthusiasm, especially towards teaching, waning.

  abstract = {Purpose Clinician-educator tracks (CETs) appear to be increasing in prevalence in graduate medical education (GME) and may play an important role in medical education workforce development. The authors conducted a scoping review to characterize the current state of knowledge about CETs' structure, content, and outcomes. Method Six databases were searched in January 2018 for English-language peer-reviewed articles published through 2017 to identify articles describing CETs in GME. To be included, the CET had to target GME learners (residents/fellows), be longitudinal, have the primary aim of developing trainees into clinician-educators (CEs), and address at least one CE core competency (direct teaching, curriculum development, mentorship/advising, leadership, assessment, educational scholarship). The authors extracted and analyzed data from included articles. Results Of 1,434 articles identified, 19 were included in the review, representing 18 separate CETs. All but 2 CETs (11\%) were specialty-specific. Most included a core curriculum with classroom-based sessions (18; 100\%), workplace-based opportunities to practice skills (17; 94\%), and a required scholarly project (16; 89\%). Seventeen (94\%) focused on skills related to direct teaching. Four (22\%) identified mentoring/advising as a core curriculum focus. Five (28\%) required project dissemination. Time spent in CETs varied widely (median: 166 hours; range: 8 hours/4-month period to 1,288 hours/2-year period). The most common reported outcomes were learner reactions (7; 39\%) and career tracking (11; 61\%). Conclusions This review yields a composite picture of the current state of CETs in GME. The results highlight the paucity of outcomes data and areas for potential standardization and future research.},

  abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a prevalent and chronic life-threatening disease. However, there is no reliable way for early diagnosis and prevention of CHD so far. The precise molecular pathological mechanism of CHD remains obscure. Therefore, developing novel biomarkers is urgently needed.In order to evaluate the potential of untargeted plasma metabolomics in biomarker discovery for characterizing CHD, plasma metabolites from patients newly diagnosed with CHD and controls were profiled using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differential metabolites were identified using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Metabolites with significant changes were subjected to binary logistic regression analysis, and a CHD prediction model was established. A total of 28 differential plasma metabolites were identified, of which the concentrations of 11 increased significantly and those of 17 decreased significantly in patients with CHD compared with controls. The altered metabolic pathways included reduced phospholipid metabolism, increased monoglyceride metabolism, and abnormal fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, binary logistic regression showed that nine metabolites could be used as potential plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of CHD. The prediction model based on these nine metabolites was then tested with an independent cohort of samples (area under the curve = 0.929).Our plasma metabolomics study not only yielded fundamental insights into dysregulated metabolism in CHD but also presented a combinatorial biomarker that might support the clinical diagnosis of CHD.},

  date = {2014},
  abstract = {High quality relationships with teachers and peers in the classroom form the foundation for the development of students’ academic engagement, achievement, and motivational resilience. This chapter offers teachers and researchers (1) a motivational framework that explains the dynamics that sustain positive and negative relationships, and (2) a set of tools for creating solutions to improve relationships. The motivational model, based on self-determination theory, posits that students develop close and supportive relationships when teachers and peers meet their fundamental needs for relatedness, competence and autonomy in school through the provision of warmth and involvement, optimal structure, and autonomy support. Relationships are undermined when teachers and peers thwart students’ basic needs through neglect, or through interactions that are rejecting, chaotic or coercive. This conceptualization provides teachers a set of tools they can use to “diagnose and treat” relationship problems in the classroom. Teachers can use their observations of students’ disaffection to identify underlying motivational issues, and shape their responses to disaffected students in ways that are more likely to renew their intrinsic motivation. Awareness of these dynamics can help teachers identify and initiate interactions likely to lead students toward more satisfying relationships with their teachers and peers. http://nsse.pressible.org/files/2014/06/0BwvxuNbLYPkgaF9senpvS2JBUU0.pdf}

Asynchronous online discussion forums are intended to support knowledge construction and higherorder thinking and are becoming even more appealing for their predictive relationship with learning. This paper describes a study that explored the complex dynamics of knowledge construction in pre-service teacher education through examining student teachers' cognitive presence in online discussion forums and their academic performance. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that certain levels of cognitive presence were associated with students' academic performance. In addition, network analysis of discussion forums revealed that student centrality within their learning networks moderated the association between the highest level of cognitive presence and academic performance. The paper concludes with discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.},

Methods\enspace{} A prospective experimental study was conducted on a sample of 173 students enrolled in neuroanatomy (2021–2022). One hundred twenty-five students individually completed the Kahoot! prior to the final exam. In addition, students enrolled in human histology during two academic courses were included in the study. The control group course (2018–2019) received a traditional teaching methodology (N\,=\,211), while Kahoot! was implemented during 2020–2021 (N\,=\,200). All students completed similar final exams for neuroanatomy and human histology based on theory tests and image exams. Results\enspace{} The correlation between the Kahoot score and the final grade was analyzed for all students enrolled in neuroanatomy who completed both exercises. The correlation between the Kahoot exercise and the theory test, image exam and final grade was significantly positive in all cases (r\,=\,0.334 p\,{$<$}\,0.001, r\,=\,0.278 p\,=\,0.002 and r\,=\,0.355 p\,{$<$}\,0.001, respectively). Moreover, students who completed the Kahoot! exercise obtained significantly higher grades in all parts of the exam. Regarding human histology, the theory tests, image exams and final grades were significantly higher when using Kahoot! versus the “traditional” methodology (p\,{$<$}\,0.001, p\,{$<$}\,0.001 and p\,=\,0.014, respectively).

  abstract = {Background: For future physicians, residency programs offer necessary extended training in specific medical specialties. Medical schools benefit from an understanding of factors that lead their students to match into certain residency specialties. One such factor, often used during the residency application process, is scores on the USA Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE). Objectives: To determine the relationship between USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores and students' residency specialty match, and the association between both USMLE scores and state of legal residency (Minnesota) at the time of admission with students staying in-state or leaving the state for residency program. Design: USMLE scores and residency match data were analyzed from five graduating classes of students at the University of Minnesota Medical School (N = 1054). Results: A MANOVA found significant differences (p {$<$} 0.001) between residency specialties and both USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, as well as the combination of the two. Students who matched in Dermatology had the highest mean USMLE scores overall, while students who matched in Family Medicine had the lowest mean scores. Students who went out of state for residency had significantly higher Step 1 scores (p = 0.027) than students who stayed in-state for residency, while there was no significant difference between the groups for Step 2 scores. A significant positive association was found between a student who applied as a legal resident of Minnesota and whether the student stayed in Minnesota for their residency program. Conclusions: Residency specialty match was significantly associated with USMLE Step 1 and USMLE Step 2 CK scores, as was staying in-state or leaving the state for residency. Students who were legal residents of the state at the time of application were more likely to stay in-state for residency, regardless of USMLE score.

  abstract = {Background The delivery of patient care in the United Kingdom is under increasing financial pressure. The need to continuously improve service delivery while making financial savings is challenging. Alongside this, National Health Service (NHS) Trusts must provide a suitable educational environment that meets the needs of all learners while meeting performance standards and targets set by external regulating authorities. This research addresses the gap in literature concerning educational culture in the NHS. Methods This case study examines the delivery of postgraduate medical education in the workplace. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 6 lead educators in the Medical Division of a North West NHS Trust to glean their insights into what works and what needs to change. Results A thematic analysis of the transcripts revealed a number of factors that facilitated and hindered educational opportunities for doctors in training, including the role of leadership, the demands of external regulatory authorities, and the pressures on frontline staff to deliver safe, personal, and effective care. Conclusion Opportunities for developing a collaborative approach between educational and clinical leaders and the individuals delivering education in the workplace to enhance the educational environment are discussed. Finally, an evaluatory toolkit based on the themes emerging from the data is proposed, as a resource for other health care organisations to help improve the delivery of workplace-based medical education.},

In the absence of vaccines and e\_ective therapeutics, reliable serological testing must be a key element of public health policy to control further spread of the disease and gradually remove quarantine measures. Serological diagnostic tests are being increasingly used to provide a broader understanding of COVID-19 incidence and to assess immunity status in the population. However, there are discrepancies between claimed and actual performance data for serological diagnostic tests on the market. In this study, we conducted a review of independent studies evaluating the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests. We found significant variability in the accuracy of marketed tests and highlight several lab-based and point-of-care rapid serological tests with high levels of performance. The findings of this review highlight the need for ongoing independent evaluations of commercialized COVID-19 diagnostic tests.},

The construct of a research lab provides a framework that can be employed to overcome these challenges and effectively support the work of medical education researchers; however, labs are relatively uncommon in the medical education field. Using case examples, the authors describe the organization and mission of medical education research labs contrasted with those of larger research team configurations, such as research centers, collaboratives, and networks. They discuss several key elements of education research labs: the importance of lab identity, the signaling effect of a lab designation, required infrastructure, and the training mission of a lab. The need for medical education researchers to be visionary and strategic when designing their labs is emphasized, start-up considerations and the likelihood of support for medical education labs is considered, and the degree to which department leaders should support such labs is questioned.},

Advances in our genetic understanding of kidney stones will lead to incredible insights regarding the pathophysiology of this common disorder. At this time, both evaluation of urine chemistry and genotyping of patients are extremely useful in the setting of a university and research-based kidney stone clinic. For much of the world, in a more clinically focused setting, these techniques are neither available nor absolutely necessary. Careful implementation of an empiric prescription based on stone composition would have an important effect to reduce stone recurrence in the world’s many stone formers. Increased fluid intake, generic dietary manipulations, and prescription of potassium citrate and thiazides are all appropriate empiric therapies for people with calcium and uric acid kidney stones.},

  abstract = {The benefits of teamwork and collaboration have long been advocated by many educational theories, such as constructivist and social learning models. Among the various applications of collaborative learning, the iterative team-based learning (TBL) process proposed by Michaelsen, Fink, and Knight (2002) has been successfully used in the classroom without computer support. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation results of a classroom application of the TBL process, which was modified to include computer mediation. We call this process computer-supported team-based learning (CS-TBL). This work extends learning in small teams from the traditional classroom to the hybrid classroom where students meet both face-to-face and online by emphasizing the importance of online team interactions. The outcomes are assessed through an evaluation model that considers the impact of motivation, enjoyment and team contributions on learning outcomes. The study results indicate that motivation influences the relationship between team interactions and perceived learning. Enjoyment is affected by motivation and perceptions of team members' contributions, with the implication that students who perceive that the team interactions are adding value to their education will better enjoy learning and will experience higher-level learning outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background: Medical education is rapidly changing where there has been decreased emphasis on passive didactics and increased focus on novel modes of teaching and learning to address the unique needs of millennial learners. As educators, it is challenging to keep up and find active teaching strategies outside of routine small group exercises to engage learners. Although the traditional small group activities, such as cased-based learning, allows for interactive and effective teaching, this modality may require the use of multiple faculty facilitators, which can be a difficult resource to find. The jigsaw learning method is cooperative learning that utilizes peer teaching and promotes collaborative learning, and additionally, only one facilitator is required of this type of learning technique. Objectives: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the jigsaw method by comparing it to the traditional small group learning method to teach principles of diagnostic reasoning. Design: Residents were assigned to either the traditional small group teaching method or the jigsaw method. We compared pre-test, post-test, one-year follow-up test results between participants, and resident perception of the exercises. Results: A 2~×~3 repeated measures ANOVA indicated statistically significant improvement in tests scores from before to after participation with the jigsaw method compared to the traditional small group method. Post-survey demonstrated higher resident satisfaction with the jigsaw method. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that a jigsaw cooperative learning approach can be used as an effective method to promote collaborative learning and engagement.},

Intentional engagement and active learning pedagogies change the nature of learning, while simultaneously improving knowledge gain and recall abilities. Students find the work more interesting and thereby put more effort into it. Historical perspective reveals that medical faculty need to make changes in their teaching methodologies. However, transforming pedagogical practice is difficult, as medical faculty have not had much exposure to pedagogical theory or training. While simple steps can be taken to alter basic lecture formatting, these steps may be unfamiliar to medical faculty. Seven methods for adapting parts of lectures are described.

Cognitive theories of development offer additional insights for curriculum designers to consider. In a discipline-based curriculum, knowledge and skills are presented as subject areas in their own right and integration has to occur entirely in the student’s head through putting it to use in practice. Curriculum design encompasses many other factors that derive from the democratisation of social processes, the development of educational theory, political imperatives, and economic concerns.},

  abstract = {Objectives: In clinical reasoning, clinicians need to switch between automatic and effortful reasoning to solve both routine and non-routine problems. This requires the ability to recognise when a problem is non-routine and adapt one's reasoning mode accordingly, that is to ‘slow down’ the reasoning process. In the current study, we explored the process of these transitions between automatic and effortful reasoning by radiologists who performed ultrasound examinations during consultations at the polyclinic. Methods: Manifestations of slowing down in clinical reasoning were explored in 41 out-patient consultations performed by five radiologists. Interviews before and after the consultations were combined with observations during the consultations to obtain proactively planned triggers, slowing down manifestations and situationally responsive initiators. Transcripts of the interviews and field notes of the observations were coded. The constant comparative method was used to classify slowing down manifestations. Results: In thirteen of the 41 consultations, slowing down moments were observed. Four manifestations of slowing down were identified: shifting, checking, searching and focusing. These manifestations mainly differed in how long radiologists maintained effortful reasoning, varying from very short periods (shifting and checking) to sustained periods (searching and focusing). Unexpected patient statements and ambiguous ultrasound images initiated the slowing down moments. Discussion: The results from this study contribute to understanding how clinicians transition from automatic to effortful reasoning. Also, this study revealed two sources of initiators of this transition in radiologists’ consultations: statements made by the patient and conflicting or ambiguous visual information, in this case from ultrasound images. Natural variations in patient statements and visual information can be used as input of what might be meaningful variation in the domain of radiology education to support expertise development.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of cross-sectional and prospective human studies evaluating metabolite markers identified using high-throughput metabolomics techniques on prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through August 2015. We conducted a qualitative review of cross-sectional and prospective studies. Additionally, meta-analyses of metabolite markers, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and type 2 diabetes risk were conducted, and multivariableadjusted relative risks of type 2 diabetes were calculated per study-specific SD difference in a given metabolite. RESULTS: We identified 27 cross-sectional and 19 prospective publications reporting associations of metabolites and prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrate (glucose and fructose), lipid (phospholipids, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides), and amino acid (branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, glycine, and glutamine) metabolites were higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Prospective studies provided evidence that blood concentrations of several metabolites, including hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides, were associated with the incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We meta-analyzed results from eight prospective studies that reported risk estimates for metabolites and type 2 diabetes, including 8,000 individuals of whom 1,940 had type 2 diabetes. We found 36\% higher risk of type 2 diabetes per study-specific SD difference for isoleucine (pooled relative risk 1.36 [1.24-1.48]; I2 = 9.5\%), 36\% for leucine (1.36 [1.17-1.58]; I2 = 37.4\%), 35\% for valine (1.35 [1.19-1.53]; I2 = 45.8\%), 36\% for tyrosine (1.36 [1.19-1.55]; I2 = 51.6\%), and 26\% for phenylalanine (1.26 [1.10-1.44]; I2 = 56\%). Glycine and glutamine were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk (0.89 [0.81-0.96] and 0.85 [0.82-0.89], respectively; both I2 = 0.0\%).

  abstract = {Background: Curriculum mapping plays an increasing role in the design and implementation of competency-based medical education. We present an exemplary mapping of an institutional undergraduate medical curriculum to a national competency-based outcome framework to compare approaches to mapping procedures in their capacity to depict the relative coverage. Methods: The mapping process was performed by a small working group that continuously reconciled its findings. In step 1, we mapped the course objectives of our programme (Charité Berlin, Germany) to the National Competency-Based Catalogue of Learning Outcomes Medicine (NKLM). In step 2, we employed three primarily quantitative approaches (single, multiple, and subordinate match) and one primarily qualitative approach (content comparison) to derive the degree of NKLM coverage. Results: In step 1, we mapped a total of 4400 programme objectives to 2105 NKLM objectives. In step 2, the quantitative approaches provided a general overview of the pattern of coverage, while the qualitative approach required more effort but provided a better representation of the scope and depth of coverage. Discussion: The mapping approach chosen markedly impacts on the results how of well an institutional curriculum covers a national standard. This study highlights the need for more rigour in the methodology and reporting of curriculum mapping.},

  abstract = {Workplace based assessment (WPBA) refers to a group of assessment modalities which evaluates trainees’ performance during the clinical settings. Hallmark of WPBA is the element of observation of the trainee’s performance in real workplace environment along with relevant feedback, thus fostering reflective practice. WPBA consists of observation of clinical performance (mini-clinical evaluation exercise, direct observation of procedural skills), discussion of clinical cases (case based discussion), and feedback from peers, coworkers, and patients (multisource feedback). This literature review was conducted on the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library. Data were retrieved by connecting Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords: ‘workplace based assessment’ AND ‘mini-clinical evaluation exercise’ AND ‘direct observation of procedural skills’ AND ‘case based discussion’ AND ‘multi-source feedback’. Additional studies were searched in the reference lists of all included articles. As WPBA is gaining popularity, there is a growing need for continuing faculty development and greater evidence regarding the validity and reliability of these instruments, which will allow the academia to embed this strategy in the existing curricula. As of today, there are conflicting reports about the educational impact of WPBA in terms of its validity and reliability. This review draws upon the spectrum of WPBA tools, their designs and applications, and an account of the existing educational impact of this emerging assessment strategy in medical education. Finally, the study reports some educational impact of WPBAs on learning and emphasises the need for more empirical research in endorsing its application worldwide.},

  abstract = {Medical and health sciences educators are increasingly employing team-based learning (TBL) in their teaching activities. TBL is a comprehensive strategy for developing and using self-managed learning teams that has created a fertile area for medical education scholarship. However, because this method can be implemented in a variety of ways, published reports about TBL may be difficult to understand, critique, replicate, or compare unless authors fully describe their interventions.The authors of this article offer a conceptual model and propose a set of guidelines for standardizing the way that the results of TBL implementations are reported and critiqued. They identify and articulate the seven core design elements that underlie the TBL method and relate them to educational principles that maximize student engagement and learning within teams. The guidelines underscore important principles relevant to many forms of small-group learning. The authors suggest that following these guidelines when writing articles about TBL implementations should help standardize descriptive information in the medical and health sciences education literature about the essential aspects of TBL activities and allow authors and reviewers to successfully replicate TBL implementations and draw meaningful conclusions about observed outcomes. © 2012 Association American Medical Colleges.

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to compare third-year dental students' satisfaction and level of learning in case-based learning (CBL) versus team-based learning (TBL) and the resources required in those two methodologies. Level of learning was assessed for both knowledge and application, and resources were defined as student and faculty time and rooms. In academic year 2018-19, all 68 third-year dental students in one U.S. dental school were enrolled in two sequential semester-long courses; the first used CBL, and the second used TBL. After each course, students and faculty facilitators completed surveys, and data from students' knowledge and application exams were collected. The student surveys asked students to report their satisfaction with the learning methodology (CBL or TBL); the faculty surveys asked the faculty facilitators to report the resources used for each methodology. Forty-five of 68 students (66\%) consented to participate; however, a larger number of students completed surveys in the two semesters (69\% for CBL and 87\% for TBL). Fourteen of 16 (88\%) faculty facilitators completed the CBL survey, and five of the six (83\%) completed the TBL survey. Overall, the results showed that students' satisfaction was higher with CBL than TBL (Mann-Whitney U=882.0; p{$<$}0.001), and students reported having a better understanding of concepts after CBL than TBL (U=899.0; p{$<$}0.001). The students performed better on knowledge exam items in TBL than CBL (86\% vs. 82\%) but the same on application items (both 86\%). Resource requirements for both methods were extensive, with TBL requiring fewer facilitators and rooms than CBL but requiring more time from both students (2.6 vs. 2.3 hours weekly) and faculty members (2.3 vs. 1.4 hours weekly). In this study, students preferred CBL to TBL but had higher knowledge scores in the TBL course. The resources needed for both CBL and TBL were said to be extensive, with infrastructure use higher for CBL but time for students and faculty higher for TBL.},

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem with very high prevalence and mortality. Yet, there is a paucity of effective treatment options, partly due to insufficient knowledge of underlying pathophysiology. We combined metabolomics (GCMS) with kidney gene expression studies to identify metabolic pathways that are altered in adults with non-diabetic stage 3–4 CKD versus healthy adults. Urinary excretion rate of 27 metabolites and plasma concentration of 33 metabolites differed significantly in CKD patients versus controls (estimate range − 68\% to + 113\%). Pathway analysis revealed that the citric acid cycle was the most significantly affected, with urinary excretion of citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate reduced by 40–68\%. Reduction of the citric acid cycle metabolites in urine was replicated in an independent cohort. Expression of genes regulating aconitate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate were significantly reduced in kidney biopsies. We observed increased urine citrate excretion (+ 74\%, p = 0.00009) and plasma 2-oxoglutarate concentrations (+ 12\%, p = 0.002) in CKD patients during treatment with a vitamin-D receptor agonist in a randomized trial. In conclusion, urinary excretion of citric acid cycle metabolites and renal expression of genes regulating these metabolites were reduced in non-diabetic CKD. This supports the emerging view of CKD as a state of mitochondrial dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Purpose Research methodologies represent assumptions about knowledge and ways of knowing. Diverse research methodologies and methodological standards for rigor are essential in shaping the collective set of knowledge in health professions education (HPE). Given this relationship between methodologies and knowledge, it is important to understand the breadth of research methodologies and their rigor in HPE research publications. However, there are limited studies examining these questions. This study synthesized current trends in methodologies and rigor in HPE papers to inform how evidence is gathered and collectively shapes knowledge in HPE. Method This descriptive quantitative study used stepwise stratified cluster random sampling to analyze 90 papers from 15 HPE journals published in 2018 and 2019. Using a research design codebook, the authors conducted group coding processes for fidelity, response process validity, and rater agreement; an index quantifying methodological rigor was developed and applied for each paper. Results Over half of research methodologies were quantitative (51\%), followed by qualitative (28\%), and mixed methods (20\%). No quantitative and mixed methods papers reported an epistemological approach. All qualitative papers that reported an epistemological approach (48\%) used social constructivism. Most papers included participants from North America (49\%) and Europe (20\%). The majority of papers did not specify participant sampling strategies (56\%) or a rationale for sample size (80\%). Among those reported, most studies (81\%) collected data within 1 year. The average rigor score of the papers was 56\% (SD = 17). Rigor scores varied by journal categories and research methodologies. Rigor scores differed between general HPE journals and discipline-specific journals. Qualitative papers had significantly higher rigor scores than quantitative and mixed methods papers. Conclusions This review of methodological breadth and rigor in HPE papers raises awareness in addressing methodological gaps and calls for future research on how the authors shape the nature of knowledge in HPE.},

This paper provides a framework based on the three-circle model: what the doctor should be able to do ('doing the right thing'), the approaches to doing it ('doing the thing right') and the development of the individual as a professional ('the right person doing it'). Twelve learning outcomes are specified, and these are further subdivided. The different outcomes have been defined at an appropriate level of generality to allow adaptability to the phases of the curriculum, to the subject-matter, to the instructional methodology and to the students' learning needs. Outcomes in each of the three areas have distinct underlying characteristics. They move from technical competences or intelligences to meta-competences including academic, emotional, analytical, creative and personal intelligences. The Dundee outcome model offers an intuitive, user-friendly and transparent approach to communicating learning outcomes. It encourages a holistic and integrated approach to medical education and helps to avoid tension between vocational and academic perspectives. The framework can be easily adapted to local needs. It emphasizes the relevance and validity of outcomes to medical practice. The model is relevant to all phases of education and can facilitate the continuum between the different phases. It has the potential of facilitating a comparison between different training programmes in medicine and between different professions engaged in health care delivery.},

Such perceptions, especially when formed at the start of a semester, can impact what students learn and how instructors teach; therefore, it is critical that these perceptions are prevented if a course is to be successful. A good starting point is the syllabus, which not only informs students about a course and its requirements, but creates a first impression about the instructor and his or her attitudes toward teaching. We conducted an experiment in which the course syllabus was manipulated to reflect a friendly or an unfriendly tone so that we could explore the perceptions students formed of the instructor and class. Results supported the hypothesis that a syllabus written in a friendly, rather than unfriendly, tone evoked perceptions of the instructor being more warm, more approachable, and more motivated to teach the course. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This study is a quantitative analysis investigating the educational and psychological effects of the pandemic on US medical students and their reactions to the AAMC recommendation in order to inform medical education policy. Methods: The authors sent a cross-sectional survey via email to medical students in their clinical training years at six medical schools during the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey questions aimed to evaluate students’ perceptions of COVID-19’s impact on medical education; ethical obligations during a pandemic; infection risk; anxiety and burnout; willingness and needed preparations to return to clinical rotations. Results: Seven hundred forty-one (29.5\%) students responded. Nearly all students (93.7\%) were not involved in clinical rotations with in-person patient contact at the time the study was conducted. Reactions to being removed were mixed, with 75.8\% feeling this was appropriate, 34.7\% guilty, 33.5\% disappointed, and 27.0\% relieved. Most students (74.7\%) agreed the pandemic had significantly disrupted their medical education, and believed they should continue with normal clinical rotations during this pandemic (61.3\%). When asked if they would accept the risk of infection with COVID-19 if they returned to the clinical setting, 83.4\% agreed. Students reported the pandemic had moderate effects on their stress and anxiety levels with 84.1\% of respondents feeling at least somewhat anxious. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (53.5\%) was the most important factor to feel safe returning to clinical rotations, followed by adequate testing for infection (19.3\%) and antibody testing (16.2\%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education of US medical students in their clinical training years. The majority of students wanted to return to clinical rotations and were willing to accept the risk of COVID-19 infection. Students were most concerned with having enough PPE if allowed to return to clinical activities.},

  abstract = {Emergency physicians (EP) make clinical decisions multiple times daily. In some instances, medical errors occur due to flaws in the complex process of clinical reasoning and decision-making. Cognitive error can be difficult to identify and is equally difficult to prevent. To reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from errors in critical thinking, it has been proposed that we train physicians to understand and maintain awareness of their thought process, to identify error-prone clinical situations, to recognize predictable vulnerabilities in thinking, and to employ strategies to avert cognitive errors. The first step to this approach is to gain an understanding of how physicians make decisions and what conditions may predispose to faulty decision-making. We review the dual-process theory, which offers a framework to understand both intuitive and analytical reasoning, and to identify the necessary conditions to support optimal cognitive processing. We also discuss systematic deviations from normative reasoning known as cognitive biases, which were first described in cognitive psychology and have been identified as a contributing factor to errors in medicine. Training physicians in common biases and strategies to mitigate their effect is known as debiasing. A variety of debiasing techniques have been proposed for use by clinicians. We sought to review the current evidence supporting the effectiveness of these strategies in the clinical setting. This discussion of improving clinical reasoning is relevant to medical educators as well as practicing EPs engaged in continuing medical education.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To examine the validity evidence for a scrub training knowledge assessment tool to demonstrate the utility and robustness of a multimodal, entrustable professional activity (EPA)-aligned, mastery learning scrub training curriculum. METHOD Validity evidence was collected for the knowledge assessment used in the scrub training curriculum at Stanford University School of Medicine from April 2017-June 2018. The knowledge assessment had 25 selected response items that mapped to curricular objectives, EPAs, and operating room policies. A mastery passing standard was established using the Mastery Angoff and Patient-Safety approaches. Learners were assessed pre-curriculum, post-curriculum, and 6 months after the curriculum. RESULTS From April 2017-June 2018, 220 medical and physician assistant students participated in the scrub training curriculum. The mean pre- and post-curriculum knowledge scores were 74.4\% (SD = 15.6) and 90.1\% (SD = 8.3), respectively, yielding a Cohen's d = 1.10, P {$<$}.001. The internal reliability of the assessment was 0.71. Students with previous scrub training performed significantly better on the pre-curriculum knowledge assessment than those without previous training (81.9\% [SD = 12.6] vs. 67.0\% [SD = 14.9]; P {$<$}.001). The mean item difficulty was 0.74, and the mean item discrimination index was 0.35. The Mastery Angoff overall cut score was 92.0\%. CONCLUSIONS This study describes the administration of and provides validity evidence for a knowledge assessment tool for a multimodal, EPA-aligned, mastery-based curriculum for scrub training. The authors support the use of scores derived from this test for assessing scrub training knowledge among medical and physician assistant students.},

  abstract = {Context: The ability to self-monitor one's performance in clinical settings is a critical determinant of safe and effective practice. Various studies have shown this form of self-regulation to be more trustworthy than aggregate judgements (i.e. self-assessments) of one's capacity in a given domain. However, little is known regarding what cues inform learners’ self-monitoring, which limits an informed exploration of interventions that might facilitate improvements in self-monitoring capacity. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of characteristics of the individual (e.g. ability) and characteristics of the problem (e.g. case difficulty) on the accuracy of self-monitoring by medical students. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 283 medical students from 5~years of study completed a computer-based clinical reasoning exercise. Confidence ratings were collected after completing each of six cases and the accuracy of self-monitoring was considered to be a function of confidence when the eventual answer was correct relative to when the eventual answer was incorrect. The magnitude of that difference was then explored as a function of year of seniority, gender, case difficulty and overall aptitude. Results: Students demonstrated accurate self-monitoring by virtue of giving higher confidence ratings (57.3\%) and taking a shorter time to work through cases (25.6~seconds) when their answers were correct relative to when they were wrong (41.8\% and 52.0~seconds, respectively; p{$<~$}0.001 and d~{$>~$}0.5 in both instances). Self-monitoring indices were related to student seniority and case difficulty, but not to overall ability or student gender. Conclusions: This study suggests that the accuracy of self-monitoring is context specific, being heavily influenced by the struggles students experience with a particular case rather than reflecting a generic ability to know when one is right or wrong. That said, the apparent capacity to self-monitor increases developmentally because increasing experience provides a greater likelihood of success with presented problems.},

Many seek support, and some present complex problems that consume substantial resources. A few continue unresolved into postgraduate life and may affect future professional performance. Early intervention may be helpful in minimising the impact on both individual students and school resources. Aim: To develop a broad classification framework for personal problems presented by medical students to student support services. Methods: We report a study of more complex student problems presenting to student support services. A three stage iterative process, involving student support faculty from several international medical schools, discussed case scenarios based on pooled experience and developed a framework for categorising and considering management. Results: Seven profiles of student problems were developed, based on composites of unidentified cases drawn from participants’ experiences, reflecting: immaturity; learning skills; organisational skills; health or personal issues and poor insight. Broad characteristics and brief prognostic comments are provided for each profile. Discussion: While profiles may overlap and each student may have a unique set of issues, there appears to be similarities that allow some categorisation for management strategies and prognostic features in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Further work is needed to develop ‘diagnostic’ assessments that might guide intervention. Conclusion: This classification may assist early intervention into personal problems presented by medical students to student support services.},

Consequently, students would have developed preferred approaches to acquiring and processing information or learning style preferences. Understanding first-year students' learning style preferences is important to success in learning. However, little is understood about how learning styles impact learning and performance across different subjects within the medical curriculum. Greater understanding of the relationship between students' learning style preferences and academic performance in specific medical subjects would be valuable. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined the learning style preferences of first-year medical students and how they differ across gender. This research also analyzed the effect of learning styles on academic performance across different subjects within a medical education program in a Central Asian university. A total of 52 students (57.7\% females) from two batches of first-year medical school completed the Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire, which measures four dimensions of learning styles: sensing-intuitive; visual-verbal; active-reflective; sequential-global. Results: First-year medical students reported preferences for visual (80.8\%) and sequential (60.5\%) learning styles, suggesting that these students preferred to learn through demonstrations and diagrams and in a linear and sequential way. Our results indicate that male medical students have higher preference for visual learning style over verbal, while females seemed to have a higher preference for sequential learning style over global. Significant associations were found between sensing-intuitive learning styles and performance in Genetics [β = -0.46, B = -0.44, p  {$<$}  0.01] and Anatomy [β = -0.41, B = -0.61, p  {$<$}  0.05] and between sequential-global styles and performance in Genetics [β = 0.36, B = 0.43, p  {$<$}  0.05]. More specifically, sensing learners were more likely to perform better than intuitive learners in the two subjects and global learners were more likely to perform better than sequential learners in Genetics. Conclusion: This knowledge will be helpful to individual students to improve their performance in these subjects by adopting new sensing learning techniques. Instructors can also benefit by modifying and adapting more appropriate teaching approaches in these subjects. Future studies to validate this observation will be valuable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of flipped classroom approach has become increasingly popular in health professions education. However, no meta-analysis has been published that specifically examines the effect of flipped classroom versus traditional classroom on student learning. This study examined the findings of comparative articles through a meta-analysis in order to summarize the overall effects of teaching with the flipped classroom approach. We focused specifically on a set of flipped classroom studies in which pre-recorded videos were provided before face-to-face class meetings. These comparative articles focused on health care professionals including medical students, residents, doctors, nurses, or learners in other health care professions and disciplines (e.g., dental, pharmacy, environmental or occupational health). METHOD: Using predefined study eligibility criteria, seven electronic databases were searched in mid-April 2017 for relevant articles. Methodological quality was graded using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Effect sizes, heterogeneity estimates, analysis of possible moderators, and publication bias were computed using the COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS software. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 28 eligible comparative studies (between-subject design) showed an overall significant effect in favor of flipped classrooms over traditional classrooms for health professions education (standardized mean difference, SMD\,=\,0.33, 95\% confidence interval, CI\,=\,0.21-0.46, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. In addition, the flipped classroom approach was more effective when instructors used quizzes at the start of each in-class session. More respondents reported they preferred flipped to traditional classrooms. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that the flipped classroom approach in health professions education yields a significant improvement in student learning compared with traditional teaching methods.},

The association of metabolite profiles across multiple cardiometabolic traits may lend insights into the interaction of obesity and metabolic health. We sought to investigate metabolic signatures of obesity and related cardiometabolic traits in the community using broad-based metabolomic profiling. Methods and Results: We evaluated the association of 217 assayed metabolites and cross-sectional as well as longitudinal changes in cardiometabolic traits among 2,383 Framingham Offspring cohort participants. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with 69 of 217 metabolites (P{$<$}0.00023 for all), including aromatic (tyrosine, phenylalanine) and branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine). Additional metabolic pathways associated with BMI included the citric acid cycle (isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, aconitate), the tryptophan pathway (kynurenine, kynurenic acid), and the urea cycle. There was considerable overlap in metabolite profiles between BMI, abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance [IR] and dyslipidemia, modest overlap of metabolite profiles between BMI and hyperglycemia, and little overlap with fasting glucose or elevated blood pressure. Metabolite profiles were associated with longitudinal changes in fasting glucose, but the involved metabolites (ornithine, 5-HIAA, aminoadipic acid, isoleucine, cotinine) were distinct from those associated with baseline glucose or other traits. Obesity status appeared to "modify" the association of 9 metabolites with IR. For example, bile acid metabolites were strongly associated with IR among obese but not lean individuals, whereas isoleucine had a stronger association with IR in lean individuals. Conclusions: In this large-scale metabolite profiling study, body mass index was associated with a broad range of metabolic alterations. Metabolite profiling highlighted considerable overlap with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, but not with fasting glucose or blood pressure traits.},

Moreover, very sensitive biomarkers are needed in drug development and clinical research to increase understanding of the efficacy and safety of potential and existing therapies. Metabolomics analyses can identify and quantify all metabolites present in a given sample, covering hundreds to thousands of metabolites. Sample preparation for metabolomics requires a very fast arrest of biochemical processes. Present key technologies for metabolomics are mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which require sophisticated biostatistic and bioinformatic data analyses. The use of metabolomics has been instrumental in identifying new biomarkers of CKD such as acylcarnitines, glycerolipids, dimethylarginines and metabolites of tryptophan, the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. Biomarkers such as c-mannosyl tryptophan and pseudouridine have better performance in CKD stratification than does creatinine. Future challenges in metabolomics analyses are prospective studies and deconvolution of CKD biomarkers from those of other diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory conditions, stress and cancer.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Many institutions require candidates to achieve a minimum number of OSCE stations passed (MNSP) in addition to the aggregate pass mark. The stated rationale is usually that this conjunctive standard prevents excessive degrees of compensation across an assessment. However, there is a lack of consideration and discussion of this practice in the medical education literature. Methods: We consider the motivations for the adoption of the MNSP from the assessment designer perspective, outlining potential concerns about the complexity of what the OSCE is trying to achieve, particularly around the blueprinting process and the limitations of scoring instruments. We also introduce four potential methods for setting an examinee-centred MNSP standard, and highlight briefly the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. Discussion and conclusion: There are psychometric arguments for and against the limiting of compensation in OSCEs, but it is clear that many stakeholders value the application of an MNSP standard. This paper adds to the limited literature on this important topic and notes that current MNSP practices are often problematic in high stakes settings. More empirical work is needed to develop understanding of the impact on pass/fail decision-making of the proposed standard setting methods developed in this paper.},

Methods: Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, A + Education and AEI through to November 2021. We included randomised-controlled trials comparing EBP teaching modes on EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes or behaviour in undergraduate and post-graduate health professions education. Risk of bias was determined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the review. Overall, no single teaching modality was identified as being superior to others at significantly increasing learner competency in EBP. Changes in learner knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour were conflicting, with studies either reporting no change, or a moderate increase in EBP behavioural outcomes when directly compared to another intervention. Conclusion: Current evidence highlights the lack of a single teaching modality that is superior than others regarding learner competency in EBP, regardless of health professions discipline or graduate status. The poor quality, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures limited conclusions. Further research should focus on the development of high-quality studies and use of psychometrically validated tools to further explore the impact of different EBP teaching modalities.},

Questions in an interactive ARS format were presented in lectures via PowerPoint presentations. Students who chose to participate in the anonymous ARS sessions submitted answers via their personal wireless devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, PDAs, etc). Students were surveyed for feedback. Student participation in ARS activities was greatest (65–80\%) in the first lecture. The number of students who actively participated in ARS activities decreased over the next four sessions, and then slightly increased in the last two sessions. This trend was the same for both years. Use of the ARS did not dramatically enhance overall student performance on examination questions that dealt with content similar to content presented in the ARS sessions. However, students who scored in the lower quartile of the examination performed better on the examination questions after the ARS was implemented. Accordingly, our findings suggest that the effect of ARS to improve student performance on examinations was not uniform. The overall benefit of an ARS to enhance the lecture experience was confirmed by student surveys. Anat Sci Educ. © 2010 American Association of Anatomists.},

  abstract = {Background: Health care providers require the ability to use critical thinking skills and work effectively in a team as a part of an overall set of competencies. Therefore, educational programs should use appropriate methods based in educational theory to effectively graduate learners with these abilities. Team-based learning (TBL) is a method that has been introduced in healthcare education to foster critical thinking skills while students work in high functioning teams. Aims: This article will show how TBL follows the principles of constructivist learning theory. Method: The principles of constructivist learning theory are discussed in relation to the teaching method of team-based learning. The effectiveness of TBL in healthcare education is then reviewed. Results: TBL is learner centered with the teacher acting as an expert facilitator and also provides students with opportunities to expose inconsistencies between their current understandings and new experiences thus stimulating development of new personal mental frameworks built upon previous knowledge. The learning is active using relevant problems and group interaction. Teamwork skills are strengthened by focused reflection on new experiences during the group sessions and on teamwork success by providing feedback to group members. Conclusion: Since these aspects are all essential components of constructivist educational theory, TBL is solidly grounded in the theory and is a promising method to strengthen healthcare education. © 2012 Informa UK.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of co-ingestion of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), arginine, and citrulline on 8 × 50 m high-intensity interval swim performance in trained young swimmers. This study used a randomized cross-over design. Eight male (age 15.6 ± 1.3 years) and eight female (age 15.6 ± 0.9 years) swimmers completed both amino acids (AA) and placebo (PL) trials. The participants ingested 0.085 g/kg body weight BCAA, 0.05 g/kg body weight arginine and 0.05 g/kg body weight citrulline before the swim test in the AA trial. The average 50 m time was significantly shorter in the AA trial than that in the PL trial. The AA trial was faster than the PL trial in the first, second, and the seventh laps. The AA trial showed significantly higher plasma BCAA concentrations and lower tryptophan/BCAA ratio. The other biochemical parameters and ratings of perceived exertion were similar between the two trials. The results showed that BCAA, arginine, and citrulline, allowed the participants to swim faster in a high-intensity interval protocol in young swimmers.},

  abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic studies suggest a strong link between poor habitual sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Metabolomic profiling may elucidate systemic differences associated with sleep quality that influence cardiometabolic health. Methods: We explored cross-sectional associations between sleep quality and plasma metabolites in a nested case-control study of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; n = 1956) and attempted to replicate the results in an independent sample from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; n = 209). A sleep-quality score (SQS) was derived from self-reported sleep problems asked in both populations. Plasma metabolomics were assayed using LC-MS with 347 known metabolites. General linear regression was used to identify individual metabolites associated with continuous SQS (false-discovery rate {$<$}0.05). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, a metabolite score was created from replicated metabolites and evaluated with CHD risk in the WHI. Results: After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and smoking, we identified 69 metabolites associated with SQS in the WHI (59 were lipids). Of these, 16 were replicated in NHSII (15 were lipids), including 6 triglycerides (TAGs), 4 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 1 diglyceride (DAG), 1 lysophosphatidylcholine and N6-acetyl-L-lysine (a product of histone acetylation). These metabolites were consistently higher among women with poorer sleep quality. The LASSO selection resulted in a nine-metabolite score (TAGs 45: 1, 48: 1, 50: 4; DAG 32: 1; PEs 36: 4, 38: 5; PCs 30: 1, 40: 6; N6-acetyl-L-lysine), which was positively associated with CHD risk (odds ratio per SD increase in the score: 1.16; 95\% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.28; p = 0.0003) in the WHI after adjustment for matching factors and conventional CHD risk factors. Conclusions: Differences in lipid metabolites may be an important pathogenic pathway linking poor habitual sleep quality and CHD risk.},

We utilize the list of influences on educational achievement compiled by John Hattie to inform a meta-analysis of learning effect sizes (ESs) associated with teaching-learning factors (TLFs) in clinical education. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify articles examining clinically relevant TLFs. Selection criteria were applied to identify learner-focused studies, with subsequent categorization by study design (pretest–posttest or controlled group). The Cohen’s ES (d) for each TLF was extracted and a pooled ES determined. Results: From 3454 studies, 132 suitable articles enabled analysis of 16 TLFs’ ESs. In general, ESs derived from pretest–posttest data were larger than those from controlled group designs, probably due to learner maturation effect. The TLFs of mastery learning, small group learning and goal settings possessed the largest ESs (d ≥ 0.8), while worked examples, play programs, questioning, concept mapping, meta-cognitive strategies, visual-perception programs and teaching strategies demonstrated ESs between 0.4 and 0.8. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide a rigorous and comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of TLFs in clinical education. We discuss the practical traits shared by effective TLFs which may assist teaching design.},

  abstract = {Objective: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and the worldwide incidence is increasing. By revealing the metabolic alterations in serum and urine of gout patients, the first aim of our study was to discover novel molecular biomarkers allowing for early diagnosis. We also aimed to investigate the underlying pathogenic pathways. Methods: Serum and urine samples from gout patients (n = 30) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 30) were analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to screen the differential metabolites and construct a diagnostic model. Next, the model was verified and optimized in the second validation cohort (n = 100). The pathways were illustrated to understand the underlying pathogenesis of gout. Results: In general, serum metabolomics demonstrated a clearer distinction than urine metabolomics. In the discovery cohort, 40 differential serum metabolites were identified that could distinguish gout patients from healthy controls. Among them, eight serum metabolites were verified in the validation cohort. Through regression analysis, the final model consisted of three serum metabolites - pyroglutamic acid, 2-methylbutyryl carnitine and Phe-Phe - that presented optimal diagnostic power. The three proposed metabolites produced an area under the curve of 0.956 (95\% CI 0.911, 1.000). Additionally, the proposed metabolic pathways were primarily involved in purine metabolism, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, bile secretion and arachidonic acid metabolism. Conclusion: The metabolomics signatures could serve as an efficient tool for early diagnosis and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of gout.},

  abstract = {Audience Response Systems (ARS) are thought to be a good way of using technology to increase engagement in the classroom and have been widely adopted by many instructors seeking to improve academic performance through student engagement. While researchers have examined the degree to which they promote cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes in the classroom, most of their findings are largely mixed and inconclusive. This meta-analysis seeks to resolve the conflicting findings. Specifically, the meta-analysis compared classrooms that did, and did not use ARS-based technologies on different cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes to examine the potential effects of using ARS. Overall, we found small but significant effects of using ARS-based technologies on a number of desirable cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes. Further analysis revealed that knowledge domain, class size, and the use of clicker questions, are among factors that significantly moderated the summary effect sizes observed among the studies in the meta-analysis. These findings hold significant implication for the implementation of clicker-based technologies in the classroom.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many physicians complete medical school and graduate medical education (GME) burdened by high debt and financial illiteracy. This places them at increased risk for ill-informed financial decisions, which can result in increased stress and anxiety and a lower quality of life. Furthermore, financial concerns impact physicians' specialty selections and may partly explain the scarcity of primary care practitioners. In response, medical wellness programmes have increasingly sought to offer personal finance education, but there is little guidance on optimal curricula. Our objective is to systematically review the existing literature examining physician financial literacy curricula and to recommend a standardised personal finance curriculum. METHODS: This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 checklist to report the results of literature searches in PubMed, ERIC, MedEdPortal, EBSCO, JSTOR and Google Scholar. Three researchers used predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select articles, including a focus on financial concepts applicable in the USA. Selected articles published between 2000 and 2022 were assessed using the BEME strength of findings tool, and further assessed using modified Côté-Turgeon and Kirkpatrick model qualitative analyses tools. FINDINGS: 49 articles met all inclusion criteria. Ten specifically described personal finance literacy curricula for medical students or GME trainees, with varied criteria for selecting instructors, topics and outcomes. All studies reported that audiences were ill prepared for making financial decisions but strongly desired financial literacy education. Qualitative analysis revealed Strength of Findings summary scores ranging from 2 to 4, while applicable Kirkpatrick Model scores were all 3 or greater. Based on these findings, a 14-module personal finance curriculum is proposed by the researchers, along with learning objectives. INTERPRETATION: Although medical students and GME trainees value financial literacy, few publications report the impact of actual curricula. These efforts vary in depth, breadth and measured impact. Future research should focus on development of valid testing instruments specifically for physicians, content standardisation, selection of credible instructors and delivery formats.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients who had a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and had undergone open surgery or percutaneous surgery were included, and patients without urolithiasis were randomly selected as controls. Urinary stones were collected and analyzed using infrared spectroscopy. Data relating to patient's age, BMI at diagnosis, serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were collected. The stone groups including calcium oxalate monohydrate-calcium oxalate dihydrate (COM-COD), COM, and uric acid were compared with one another and with the control group. In addition, the stone formers group (COM-COD, COM, uric acid, calcium phosphate, and mixed-type stones) was compared to the control group. RESULTS: BMI, TC, and TG levels were significantly higher in stone formers compared with the control group; this association of BMI and TC with stone formation was more prominent in uric acid and COM-COD stone formers, but there was no such prominence for COM stones. LDL-C levels in COM-COD stone formers were significantly higher when compared with COM stone formers. CONCLUSION: Elevated BMI, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia, which are leading components of metabolic syndrome, may be associated with different types of urinary stone formation.},

  abstract = {An Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is an assessment approach employed in medical education, in which residents rotate through multiple stations of standardized clinical tasks to evaluate their clinical competence. Because items used to evaluate residents’ performance in each OSCE station are linked to the same task and are rated by the same rater, their ratings may be dependent on one another, violating the assumption of conditional item independence that underlies the multi-faceted Rasch measurement (MFRM) model. We employed a MFRM model to analyze a communication skills assessment of 79 residents, using 6 OSCE stations, each scored on 18 five-point rating scale items. When we treated the rating on each item as a separate scoring unit, MFRM analyses showed item dependency in 65\% of item pairs within an OSCE station according to Fisher’s Z statistic, a modification of Yen’s Q3 index of item dependency. This resulted in overestimation of resident separation reliability and inaccurate parameter estimation. Combining item scores in each OSCE station into a station score and using station as a scoring unit reduced the amount of item dependency to 27\%. This approach produced more realistic reliability estimates and helped improve the fit of the data to the model.},

  abstract = {Background Audience response system provides a mechanism to engage larger groups as active participants in teaching sessions. However, they are traditionally based on â € fixed' closed loop system, which limits their functionality to a single geographical location, thus has the effect of confining their use to universities and other larger institutions, with a primary focus on education. Conversely, in the healthcare education context, the majority of formal education is undertaken through postgraduate training programmes, largely conducted in smaller cohorts in clinical settings. Objective The purpose of this review is to evaluate audience response systems in terms of feasibility of implementation and the impact on participation within the field of education of healthcare professionals, in comparison to the non-healthcare education. Study selection Therefore, systematic structured searches of PubMed and Medline databases for healthcare education were conducted, and Scopus, Education Resources Information Center, British Education Index, Education Abstracts, Education Administration Abstracts and PsycINFO databases for non-healthcare education databases. Findings and conclusions Consistent and fundamental differences were found in the studies evaluating healthcare education compared with other fields, with more difficulties encountered in implementation and a less significant impact on engagement seen. Here we discuss the consequences of these findings on the use of audience response systems and beyond.},

Game-based learning has become more common in the education and one of the emerging game-based learning platform used in education institutions is Kahoot. This paper investigated the perception of students towards Kahoot as a formative assessment tool in undergraduate medical education and its association with gender. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on first year medical students in a Malaysian public medical school. The study employed a survey that consists of 12 items through Kahoot survey platform. Result: A total of 113 subjects participated in this study; majority was female (68.1\%) and Malay (58.4\%). The students highly perceived Kahoot as fun, effective and better than e-learning platform for feedback as its median score was 4. The rest of items were satisfactorily perceived by the students as indicated by the score of 3 except for simplifying complex subjects that obtained unsatisfactory level. There were significant median score differences between male and female students for motivation and perceived knowledge retention, whereby males scored higher than females (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Kahoot is a promising formative assessment tool that is feasible, practical and makes learning fun and enjoyable. It can be used to motivate students to learn. However, Kahoot was not the best tool to simplify complex subjects as perceived by medical students.},

The present study was designed to investigate if prenatal testosterone exposure is a candidate for having a causal role in sexual dimorphism observed in learning style preferences. A total of 183 students (mean age: 20.65 ± 2.42) from a population of 247 (74\%) were enrolled in the study. Learning style preference was determined via the Turkish version of the learning style inventory, and the digit lengths of both hands were measured using digital calipers. Unimodal learning was more frequent among males (30.6\% vs. 17.1\%; p {$<$} 0.01). There was no marked difference in learning styles with respect to age. Digit ratio (2D/4D) of both hands was determined to be significantly lower in males, when compared to females (p {$<$} 0.001). Lower 2D/4D ratios were determined to be associated with unimodal learning significantly in both genders.

  abstract = {We studied the effects of cholesterol load on urinary stone in rats receiving a  standard diet or a high fat diet. Sixty male rats were randomized to two groups and were fed either a standard diet (SD group) or a high fat diet (HFD group) for 8 weeks. Then the two groups were further divided into four groups. SD group, HFD group, SD + EG group (with standard diet + ethylene glycol administration for two weeks), and HFD + EG group (with high fat diet + ethylene glycol administration). The starting date of EG administration was considered to be week 0. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected in week 0, week 1, and week 2, and oxalate excretion and citrate excretion were measured by capillary electrophoresis analyzer The excretion of phosphorus, magnesium, and creatinine for 24 hours was measured using an automated analyzer Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and glucose were determined using an automated analyzer The kidney tissues were obtained to perform hematoxyline-eosine staining and Pizzolato's staining to detect oxalate-containing crystals. The average body weight in HFD groups and HFD + EG group in week 0 was significantly higher than that of SD group and SD + EG group. The calcium oxalate crystal deposition was not observed in all groups in week 0. HFD + EG group in week 1 had sporadically calcium oxalate crystal deposition in renal distal tubular cells and tubular lumens. In week 2, the number of crystal deposition in HFD + EG group was increased remarkably. The crystals were slightly observed in SD + EG group in week 2. The excretion of urinary calcium and phosphate in HFD group and HFD + EG group was significantly higher than that of the SD group and SD + EG group in week 0. The amount of urinary citrate excretion in the SD group and SD + EG group showed a significantly higher value compared with that of the HFD group and HFD + EG group in week 0. The level of serum total cholesterol in the HFD group and HFD + EG group was higher compared to that in the SD group and SD + EG group. The serum triglyceride level was not significantly different in the four groups in week 0. Interestingly, the level of triglyceride of EG administration groups (SD + EG and HFD + EG group) was significantly higher than that in EG no-administration groups (SD group and HFD group) in week 1 and week 2. The serum glucose level in the HFD group and HFD + EG group was significantly higher than that in the SD group and SD + EG group in week 0. In week 2, the glucose level of EG administration groups (HDF + EG group and SD + EG group) was significantly lower than that of EG no-administration groups (HFD group and SD group). In conclusion, this result suggested that long-term loading of cholesterol could increase renal calcium stone formation.},

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Karachi, to investigate the usefulness of formative assessment based on the use of Kahoot, a quiz-based learning platform, in undergraduate setting.Six lectures were offered to undergraduate medical students with integration of assessment for learning (AfL) activities. Students' perception was sought via questionnaire regarding effectiveness of quizzing on classroom dynamics, meaningful learning and assessment practice. Results: Of the 171 respondents, 155(91\%) stated that technology-enriched methodologies were in line to their learning strategy while 138(81\%) students rated their experience with technology-supported assessment for learning as "Excellent". The students perceived highest positive influence on the classroom dynamics [109(63.8\%)], followed by assistance to learning [100(58.58\%)] and assessment performance [88(51.7\%)]. Overall, 133(78\%) students agreed to the notion that quizzes aided in summarisation of concept and consolidation of essential content. Additionally, 113(66\%) participant expressed that anonymity helped them take quizzes as earnest opportunity to learn without any fright of failure. Conclusion: AfL leads to a paradigm shift in the classroom, transferring the ownership of learning to the students. There is a need to implement such activities as a routine across diverse educational settings such as labs, lectures or even clinical rotations.},

Settings and participants: Participants were 392 senior students who had completed their final internship recruited from two nursing programmes in central Taiwan. Methods: Administration and completion of the following structured questionnaires: the Competency Inventory of Nursing Students, the Teaching Competence of Nurse Preceptor questionnaire, the Student Evaluation of the Clinical Education Environment, Level of Reflective Thinking, and the Metacognitive Inventory for Nursing Students. Results: The results suggested that teaching competence may indirectly affect nursing competence through metacognition and reflection. The clinical learning environment may directly affect nursing competence or indirectly affect nursing competence through metacognition. Both metacognition and reflection have direct effects on nursing competence, and reflection exerts indirect effects on nursing competence through metacognition. The path relationships differed according to the employment plan group. Conclusions: Reflection and metacognition are essential skills for the development of nursing competence in clinical settings. Clinical instructors must facilitate student learning by fostering a positive learning environment and teach students the reflective and self-regulation skills necessary to achieve favourable learning outcomes in clinical settings.},

A countrywide mass vaccination campaign with the use of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine (CoronaVac) was conducted in Chile starting on February 2, 2021. METHODS We used a prospective national cohort, including participants 16 years of age or older who were affiliated with the public national health care system, to assess the effectiveness of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with regard to preventing Covid-19 and related hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. We estimated hazard ratios using the extension of the Cox proportional-hazards model, accounting for time-varying vaccination status. We estimated the change in the hazard ratio associated with partial immunization (≥14 days after receipt of the first dose and before receipt of the second dose) and full immunization (≥14 days after receipt of the second dose). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with adjustment for individual demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The study was conducted from February 2 through May 1, 2021, and the cohort included approximately 10.2 million persons. Among persons who were fully immunized, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 65.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 65.2 to 66.6) for the prevention of Covid-19 and 87.5\% (95\% CI, 86.7 to 88.2) for the prevention of hospitalization, 90.3\% (95\% CI, 89.1 to 91.4) for the prevention of ICU admission, and 86.3\% (95\% CI, 84.5 to 87.9) for the prevention of Covid-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectively prevented Covid-19, including severe disease and death, a finding that is consistent with results of phase 2 trials of the vaccine.

  abstract = {Background: To improve the quality of education, many academic medical institutions are investing in the application of blended education to support new teaching and learning methods. To take necessary measures to implement the blended learning smoothly, and to achieve its goals, we aimed to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) from its key users’ viewpoints. Methods: A qualitative study consisting of 24 interviews with lecturers and students and document analysis was conducted at Urmia University of Medical Sciences, in Iran, in 2018. The SWOT framework was used to analyze the data. Results: The most important strengths were the promotion of lecturer-student interactions, the focus on students’ learning needs and self-learning, and problem-solving skills. The supports of university executives, alignment with the national health education transformation plan, and access to the shared infrastructures of the national virtual medical science university were opportunities to facilitate its implementation. However, this endeavor had weaknesses such as bottlenecks in technical, organizational, and human resource infrastructures and lack of culture readiness. The threats envisioned for its maintenance were its dependency on the education transformation plan and the lack of an independent e-learning center for better planning and support services, lack of proper evaluation and supervision of virtual activities, and insufficiency of the privileges considered for users. Conclusions: One of the important implications of this study is that different aspects surrounding blended learning might work as a double-edge sword from time to time, which requires a thorough overview. While retaining the strengths and enjoying the opportunities in such interventions, the weaknesses should be recognized and threats are faced and addressed. Therefore, if the SWOT items are considered mindfully, they can help to adopt the right implementation strategies to reap full benefits.},

  abstract = {Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities must decide which groups to prioritise for vaccination in a shifting social–epidemiological landscape in which the success of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions requires broad social acceptance. We aimed to compare projected COVID-19 mortality under four different strategies for the prioritisation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Methods: We developed a coupled social–epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which social and epidemiological dynamics interact with one another. We modelled how population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions responds to case incidence. In the model, schools and workplaces are also closed and reopened on the basis of reported cases. The model was parameterised with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, population mobility, and demography from Ontario, Canada (population 14·5 million). Disease progression parameters came from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological literature. We assumed a vaccine with 75\% efficacy against disease and transmissibility. We compared vaccinating those aged 60 years and older first (oldest-first strategy), vaccinating those younger than 20 years first (youngest-first strategy), vaccinating uniformly by age (uniform strategy), and a novel contact-based strategy. The latter three strategies interrupt transmission, whereas the first targets a vulnerable group to reduce disease. Vaccination rates ranged from 0·5\% to 5\% of the population per week, beginning on either Jan 1 or Sept 1, 2021. Findings: Case notifications, non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence, and lockdown undergo successive waves that interact with the timing of the vaccine programme to determine the relative effectiveness of the four strategies. Transmission-interrupting strategies become relatively more effective with time as herd immunity builds. The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72 000 deaths (95\% credible interval 40 000–122 000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 1·5\% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 90·8\% on average (followed by 89·5\% in the uniform, 88·9\% in the contact-based, and 88·2\% in the youngest-first strategies). 60 000 deaths (31 000–108 000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 92·6\% on average (followed by 92·1\% in the uniform, 91·0\% in the oldest-first, and 88·3\% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 1·5\% of the population per week. Interpretation: The most effective vaccination strategy for reducing mortality due to COVID-19 depends on the time course of the pandemic in the population. For later vaccination start dates, use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission might prevent more deaths than prioritising vulnerable age groups.

  abstract = {Contemporary literature on online and distance education almost unequivocally argues for the importance of interactions in online learning settings. Nevertheless, the relationship between different types of interactions and learning outcomes is rather complex. Analyzing 204 offerings of 29 courses, over the period of six years, this study aimed at expanding the current understanding of the nature of this relationship. Specifically, with the use of trace data about interactions and utilizing the multilevel linear mixed modeling techniques, the study examined whether frequency and duration of studentestudent, studenteinstructor, studentesystem, and studentecontent interactions had an effect of learning outcomes, measured as final course grades. The findings show that the time spent on studentesystem interactions had a consistent and positive effect on the learning outcome, while the quantity of studentecontent interactions was negatively associated with the final course grades. The study also showed the importance of the educational level and the context of individual courses for the interaction types supported. Our findings further confirmed the potential of the use of trace data and learning analytics for studying learning and teaching in online settings. However, further research should account for various qualitative aspects of the interactions used while learning, different pedagogical/media features, as well as for the course design and delivery conditions in order to better explain the association between interaction types and the learning achievement. Finally, the results might imply the need for the development of the institutional and program-level strategies for learning and teaching that would promote effective pedagogical approaches to designing and guiding interactions in online and distance learning settings.},

Contrary to the traditional didactic model where the teacher assumes the central role and students are passive listeners, TBL participants are actively involved in the learning process. Teachers act as facilitators while the TBL participants work in groups to solve problems through engagement with their peers. The objective of the article is to conduct a systematic review on team-based learning using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic~Reviews~and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The studies were searched in databases like PubMed®, Scopus®, Embase®, and PubMed Central® using appropriate keywords. Two authors screened the papers, and a third author resolved the conflicts. This was followed by a bibliographic review based on the references of the selected study and bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool. The team-based learning model is increasingly being used by different institutions globally. TBL and traditional lecture-based teaching outcomes revealed that TBL participants performed better in academic, clinical, and communication domains. In addition, TBL enhanced learners' engagement, collaborative spirit, and satisfaction.~Our study results are similar to the prior meta-analysis and systematic review. Nevertheless, this systematic review remains more comprehensive, up-to-date, and inclusive thus far. Team-based learning is a pragmatic and superior approach to learning among health care professionals. It has resulted in better academic, clinical, and communication outcomes. This finding spans all the medical and allied professions studied in this systematic review.},

  abstract = {Context: Accurate self-assessment of one's performace on a moment-by-moment basis (ie, accurate self-monitoring) is vital for the self-regulation of practising physicians and indeed for the effective regulation of self-directed learning during medical education. However, little is currently known about the functioning of self-monitoring and its co-development with medical knowledge across medical education. This study is the first to simultaneously investigate a number of relevant aspects and measures that have so far been studied separately: different measures of self-monitoring for a broad area of medical knowledge across 10 different performance levels. Methods: This study assessed the self-monitoring accuracy of medical students (n~=~3145) across 10 semesters. Data collected during the administration of the formative Berlin Progress Test Medicine (PTM) were analysed. The PTM comprises 200 multiple-choice questions covering all major medical disciplines and organ systems. A self-report indicator (ie, confidence) and two behavioural indicators of self-monitoring accuracy (ie, response time and the likelihood of changing an initial answer to a correct rather than an incorrect item) were examined for their development over semesters. Results: Analyses of more than 390~000 observations (of approximately 250 students per semester) showed that confidence was higher for correctly than for incorrectly answered items and that 86\% of items answered with high confidence were indeed correct. Response time and the likelihood of the initial answer being changed were higher when the initial answer was incorrect than when it was correct. Contrary to expectations, no differences in self-monitoring accuracy were observed across semesters. Conclusions: Convergent evidence from different measures of self-monitoring suggests that medical students self-monitor their knowledge on a question-by-question basis well, although not perfectly, and to the same degree as has been found in studies outside medicine. Despite large differences in performance, no variations in self-monitoring across semesters (with the exception of the first semester) were observed.},

This study aimed to verify the effects of this innovative blended educational strategy on knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction of undergraduate nursing students undergoing public healthcare education. Methods: The subjects were undergraduate nursing students enrolled in H University in South Korea. The experiment was conducted over a period of 8 weeks in the public healthcare course. Two groups, blended learning (A flipped classroom with team-based learning) which was the experimental group and traditional lecture-based classroom group, the control group, were assessed. In the blended learning group, the students had pre-class, in-class (including team-based learning elements), and post-class learning elements. The two groups were compared on the following learning outcomes: knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction. Results: Results showed that the blended learning instructional methods, in comparison with traditional lectures, enhanced the students’ knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction in the public healthcare course. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of the flipped classroom with team-based learning as a blended learning strategy, able to produce improvements in nursing students’ learning outcomes. Blended learning approaches may be an effective alternative to conventional approaches in nursing education.},

All responses are instantly presented, in chart form, then reviewed and discussed by the instructor and the class. A brief history of ARSs is offered including a discussion of the 26 labels used to identify this technology. Next a detailed review of 67 peer-reviewed papers from 2000 to 2007 is offered presenting the benefits and challenges associated with the use of an ARS. Key benefits for using ARSs include improvements to the classroom environment (increases in attendance, attention levels, participation and engagement), learning (interaction, discussion, contingent teaching, quality of learning, learning performance), and assessment (feedback, formative, normative). The biggest challenges for teachers in using ARSs are time needed to learn and set up the ARS technology, creating effective ARS questions, adequate coverage of course material, and ability to respond to instantaneous student feedback. Student challenges include adjusting to a new method of learning, increased confusion when multiple perspectives are discussed, and negative reactions to being monitored. It is concluded that more systematic, detailed research is needed in a broader range of contexts.},

This review analyses the literature exploring the link between MetS/obesity and KSD and the impact that obesity has on KSD management. Recent Findings: Metabolic syndrome has been shown to increase an individual’s risk of developing kidney stone disease, with insulin resistance forming a core component of the pathophysiology. The body habitus of an individual also influences the type of intervention that is most appropriate, with flexible ureteroscopy increasingly being the preferred option in obese patients. Summary: It is important for urologists to consider the features of metabolic syndrome to effectively manage episodes of KSD in obese patients. In addition, better quality evidence is required to effectively compare different treatment options in this group of patients.},

  abstract = {Methods: Following ethical approval, medical student volunteers from four medical schools (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) participated in simulation sessions, were debriefed with an emphasis on NTS using a behavioural marker system and then took part in focus groups. Focus group discussions were semi-structured and questions were based on the phases of perspective transformation identified by Jack Mezirow. Focus group discussions were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, anonymised and analysed using template analysis. Results: A total of 33 medical students took part in five focus groups. There was evidence of the following stages of perspective transformation: Phase 2 (self-examination with emotional disturbance, including fear, anxiety, guilt, shame and frustration); Phase 3 (critical assessment of assumptions, including the undervaluing of NTS, recognising that technical skills alone are insufficient, and recognising that it is possible to improve one’s NTS); Phase 5 (exploring options for new roles, relationships and actions), and Phase 6 (planning a course of action for future simulations, as a medical student and as a doctor). Conclusions: This study deepens our understanding of how exposure to NTS training in simulation-based education influences the learning of medical students and shows that such exposure can result in the cognitive phases of transformative learning. It provides us with valuable insights into medical students' perspectives on their learning of NTS at a pivotal stage in training and represents an interesting way of assessing the educational impact of such sessions.},

  abstract = {The practical aspects and potential benefits of team-based learning (TBL) are outlined on the recent guide published by Parmelee et al. (2012). TBL provides a strategy for active student-centred collaborative learning which involves multiple small groups in a single classroom setting, incorporating many of the adult approaches to learning, more frequently seen in problem-based learning (PBL). A single teacher who is a content-expert, who need not have any experience in the group processes to deliver a successful session, instructs the student groups. Unlike PBL and traditional small group learning, TBL provides opportunities to hold each student accountable for their own performance and their individual contributions to the team (Parmelee et al. 2012). A limited search of 'PubMed' revealed that TBL is being used and evaluated internationally as an educational strategy, with virtually no published papers on TBL from the UK. This may suggest either little current interest on the use of TBL by UK medical educators or that the UK is currently not contributing a great deal to the literature on TBL. There may be a need to research the effectiveness and outcomes of TBL in a UK context of medical education. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.},

Little is known about the general cognitive actions underlying the strategies of problem-solving among medical students. In this study, a theory-based model was used and adapted in order to investigate the cognitive actions in which medical students are engaged when dealing with a case and how patterns of these actions are related to the correct solution.Methods:Twenty-three medical students worked on three cases on clinical nephrology using the think-aloud method. The transcribed recordings were coded using a theory-based model consisting of eight different cognitive actions. The coded data was analysed using time sequences in a graphical representation software. Furthermore the relationship between the coded data and accuracy of diagnosis was investigated with inferential statistical methods.Results:The observation of all main actions in a case elaboration, including evaluation, representation and integration, was considered a complete model and was found in the majority of cases (56\%). This pattern significantly related to the accuracy of the case solution (φ = 0.55; p{$<$}.001). Extent of prior knowledge was neither related to the complete model nor to the correct solution.Conclusions:The proposed model is suitable to empirically verify the cognitive actions of problem-solving of medical students. The cognitive actions evaluation, representation and integration are crucial for the complete model and therefore for the accuracy of the solution. The educational implication which may be drawn from this study is to foster students reasoning by focusing on higher level reasoning. © 2013 Kiesewetter et al.},

Study Design Cohort study. Setting \& Participants 239,331 Korean adults who underwent a health checkup examination during January 2002 to December 2014 and were followed up annually or biennially through December 2014. Predictor Baseline serum uric acid levels of participants. Outcome The development of nephrolithiasis during follow-up. Measurements Nephrolithiasis is determined based on ultrasonographic findings. A parametric Cox model was used to estimate the adjusted HRs of nephrolithiasis according to serum uric acid level. Results During 1,184,653.8 person-years of follow-up, 18,777 participants developed nephrolithiasis (incidence rate, 1.6/100 person-years). Elevated uric acid level was significantly associated with increased risk for nephrolithiasis in a dose-response manner (P for trend {$<$} 0.001) in men. This dose-response association was not observed in women. In male participants, multivariable-adjusted HRs for incident nephrolithiasis comparing uric acid levels of 6.0 to 6.9, 7.0 to 7.9, 8.0 to 8.9, 9.0 to 9.9, and ≥10.0~mg/dL with uric acid levels {$<$} 6.0~mg/dL were 1.06 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.11), 1.11 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.16), 1.21 (95\% CI, 1.13-1.29), 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.46), and 1.72 (95\% CI, 1.44-2.06), respectively. This association was observed in all clinically relevant subgroups and persisted even after adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Limitations Dietary information and computed tomographic diagnosis of nephrolithiasis were unavailable. Conclusions In this large cohort study, increased serum uric acid level was modestly and independently associated with increased risk for the development of nephrolithiasis in a dose-response manner in apparently healthy men.},

  abstract = {Importance: Vaccine-associated myocarditis is an unusual entity that has been described for the smallpox vaccine, but only anecdotal case reports have been described for other vaccines. Whether COVID-19 vaccination may be linked to the occurrence of myocarditis is unknown. Objective: To describe a group of 7 patients with acute myocarditis over 3 months, 4 of whom had recent messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: All patients referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at Duke University Medical Center were asked to participate in a prospective outcomes registry. Two searches of the registry database were performed: first, to identify patients with acute myocarditis for the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30 for 2017 through 2021, and second, to identify all patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis for the past 20 years. Once patients with possible vaccine-associated myocarditis were identified, data available in the registry were supplemented by additional data collection from the electronic health record and a telephone interview. Exposures: mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Occurrence of acute myocarditis by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Results: In the 3-month period between February 1 and April 30, 2021, 7 patients with acute myocarditis were identified, of which 4 occurred within 5 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Three were younger male individuals (age, 23-36 years) and 1 was a 70-year-old female individual. All 4 had received the second dose of an mRNA vaccine (2 received mRNA-1273 [Moderna], and 2 received BNT162b2 [Pfizer]). All presented with severe chest pain, had biomarker evidence of myocardial injury, and were hospitalized. Coincident testing for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses provided no alternative explanation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were typical for myocarditis, including regional dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement, and elevated native T1 and T2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, magnetic resonance imaging findings were found to be consistent with acute myocarditis in 7 patients; 4 of whom had preceding COVID-19 vaccination. Further investigation is needed to determine associations of COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis.},

Will they be motivated enough really to explore? Theory and research suggest that learners can and will, if the instructional systems are well-designed and if the learners are adequately prepared. In this paper, the components of learner control, self-regulated learning, and continuing motivation are examined as possible requirements and benefits of effective interactive instruction. A theoretical framework is advanced which illustrates the interdependence and mutual importance of these three components.

  abstract = {Background and objectives Prior work has suggested a higher risk of hypertension in kidney stone formers but lacked disease validation and adjustment for potential confounders. Certain types of stone formers may also be at higher risk of hypertension. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements In our study, incident symptomatic stone formers in Olmsted County from 2000 to 2011 were manually validated by chart review and age and sex matched to Olmsted County controls. We followed up patients through November 20, 2015. Hypertension was also validated by manual chart review, and the risk of hypertension in stone formers compared with controls was assessed both univariately and after adjusting for comorbidities. The risk of hypertension among different subtypes of stone formers was also evaluated. Results Among 3023 coded stone formers from 2000 to 2011, a total of 1515 were validated and matched to 1515 controls (mean age was 45 years old, and 56\% were men). After excluding those with baseline hypertension (20\% of stone formers and 18\% of controls), 154 stone formers and 110 controls developed hypertension. Median follow-up time was 7.8 years in stone formers and 9.6 years in controls. Stone formers were found to have a higher risk of hypertension compared with controls (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95\% confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.92), even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, serum creatinine, CKD, diabetes, gout, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.21). Results were similar after excluding patients who were ever on a thiazide diuretic (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95\% confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.38). Stone composition, radiographic stone burden, number of subsequent stone events, and stone removal surgeries were not associated with hypertension (P.0.05 for all). Conclusions The risk of hypertension was higher after the first symptomatic kidney stone event. However, kidney stone severity, type, and treatment did not associate with hypertension.},

  abstract = {There are many calls in the literature for changes in how medical students are educated. Although many curricular innovations have been attempted, a look at the theory behind how complex skills are learned provides useful information to guide new curriculum developments. The requirement of deliberate practice as the road map for success in the learning of clinical skills suggests that perhaps the current clinical milieu is not an optimal place for medical students to learn. The idiosyncrasy inherent in the dramatically changed medical landscape of the last 20 years makes it difficult for such practice to occur; the apprentice model of legitimate peripheral participation in a community of practice as it used to exist does no longer. Indeed, current workplace environments are at odds with the needs of medical students. Overwhelming numbers of goals and objectives in existing third-year clerkships serve as wish lists of what students should learn. They should be replaced by a systematic, longitudinal curriculum in which all students can be guaranteed to have encountered the core clinical competencies as defined. Moving the goals and objectives of the current clerkships to a longitudinal, spiral curricular format frees up clinical time in the third year to be used for students to find their future specialty and socialize into medicine. Doing so allows for an opportunity for students to spend extended time in areas of their interest. Moving to such a new curriculum format maximizes and optimizes learning while embracing the reality of current clinical workplace environments.}

A defining feature of FAMs is the development and application of a matrix-based analytical framework. These methods can be used across research paradigms and are thus particularly useful tools in the health professions education (HPE) researcher's toolbox. Despite their utility, FAMs are not frequently used in HPE research. In this AMEE Guide, we provide an overview of FAMs and their applications, situating them within specific qualitative research approaches. We also report the specific characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of FAMs in relation to other popular qualitative analysis methods. Using a specific type of FAM-i.e. the framework method-we illustrate the stages typically involved in doing data analysis with an FAM. Drawing on Sandelowski and Barroso's continuum of data transformation, we argue that FAMs tend to remain close to raw data and be descriptive or exploratory in nature. However, we also illustrate how FAMs can be harnessed for more interpretive analyses. We propose that FAMs are valuable resources for HPE researchers and demonstrate their utility with specific examples from the HPE literature.},

Our findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other disciplines.

However, one LMS feature that is often overlooked is the LMS's ability to record data that can be used for further analysis. In this article, the authors present a case study illustrating how one medical school used data that are routinely collected via the school's LMS to make informed decisions. The case study started with one instructor's observation that some teams in one of the undergraduate medical education learning modules appeared to be struggling during one of the team activities; that is, some teams seemed unable to explain or justify their responses to items on the team readiness assurance test (tRAT). Following this observation, the authors conducted 4 analyses. Their analyses demonstrate how LMS-generated and recorded data can be used in a systematic manner to investigate issues in the real educational environment. The first analysis identified a team that performed significantly poorer on the tRAT. A subsequent analysis investigated whether the weaker team's poorer performance was consistent over a whole module. Findings revealed that the weaker team performed poorer on the majority of the TBL sessions. Further investigation using LMS data showed that the weaker performance was due to the lack of preparation of one individual team member (rather than a collective poor tRAT performance). Using the findings obtained from this case study, the authors hope to convey how LMS data are powerful and may form the basis of evidence-based educational decision making.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Since team-based learning (TBL) was introduced as a medical education strategy in 2001, few studies have explored its impact on learning outcomes, particularly as measured by performance on examinations. Educators considering implementing TBL need evidence of its effectiveness. This study was conducted to determine whether student performance on examinations is affected by participation in TBL and whether TBL benefits lower- or higher-performing students. METHOD: The authors analyzed the performance of second-year medical students on 28 comprehensive course examinations over two consecutive academic years (2003-2004, 2004-2005) at the Boonshoft School of Medicine. RESULTS: The 178 students (86 men, 92 women) included in the study achieved 5.9\% (standard deviation [SD] 5.5) higher mean scores on examination questions that assessed their knowledge of pathology-based content learned using the TBL strategy compared with questions assessing pathology-based content learned via other methods (P {$<$} .001, t test). Students whose overall academic performance placed them in the lowest quartile of the class benefited more from TBL than did those in the highest quartile. Lowest-quartile students' mean scores were 7.9\% (SD 6.0) higher on examination questions related to TBL modules than examination questions not related to TBL modules, whereas highest-quartile students' mean scores were 3.8\% (SD 5.4) higher (P = .001, two-way analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS: Medical students' higher performance on examination questions related to course content learned through TBL suggests that TBL enhances mastery of course content. Students in the lowest academic quartile may benefit more than highest-quartile students from the TBL strategy. Copyright © 2010 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.},

  abstract = {Problem: Faculty coaching is recognized as an essential element for effective use of portfolios in undergraduate medical education, yet best practices for training these coaches are uncertain. Intervention: New portfolio coaches participated in a multifaceted training program that included orienting modules, a 7.5-hr training workshop featuring analysis of reflective writing, an Observed Structured Teaching Exercise (OSTE), and subsequent longitudinal coaches’ meetings for timely task training. Four desired coaching skills were emphasized in the initial training: creating a safe environment, explicitly using performance data, asking questions that elicit reflection, and guiding the student to develop future goals and plans. We collected and analyzed several outcomes: (a) coaches’ self-assessment at key intervals, (b) open-ended written responses to three coaching vignettes, (c) video recordings of the OSTE, and (d) subsequent student evaluation of the coach. In an attempt to capture learning from the workshop, both the responses to written vignettes and the video-recorded encounters were coded for presence or absence of the four desired skills. Context: Our portfolio and coaching program was instituted as part of a major undergraduate medical education reform. A new cohort of 25 coaches is enrolled with each matriculating student class, and each coach is assigned to work individually with 8–10 students, forming a coaching relationship that continues over 4~years. Coaches are compensated at 5\% full-time equivalent. Outcome: On coach self-assessment, the majority of coaches reported significant improvement in their perceived ability to assess a student's level of reflection, enhance reflection, use performance data, and guide a student to develop goals and plans. After two semesters, coach perception of improved abilities persisted. Students rated coaches as excellent (82\%), reporting that coaches created safe environments (99\%), promoted insight (92\%), and aided in goal setting (97\%). Written responses to vignettes before the OSTE found that several coaches omitted desired behaviors; however, posttraining responses showed no discernable pattern of learning. Coding of the OSTE, in contrast, documented that all coaches demonstrated all four of the desired skills. Lessons Learned: Although coaches reported learning related to key skills, learning was not apparent when responses to written vignettes were examined. In contrast, skills were demonstrated in the OSTE, perhaps due to the added structured tasks as well as anticipation of feedback. In conclusion, this portfolio coach training program achieved its desired aim of providing students with portfolio coaches who demonstrated the desired skills, as reported by both coaches and students.},

In addition, the kidneys have a central role in metabolite anabolism and catabolism, as well as in active metabolite reabsorption and/or secretion during tubular passage. This review article illustrates how the coupling of genomics and metabolomics in genome-wide association analyses of metabolites can be used to illuminate mechanisms underlying human metabolism, with a special focus on insights relevant to nephrology. First, genetic susceptibility loci for reduced kidney function and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were reviewed systematically for their associations with metabolite concentrations in metabolomics studies of blood and urine. Second, kidney function and CKD-associated metabolites reported from observational studies were interrogated for metabolite-associated genetic variants to generate and discuss complementary insights. Finally, insights originating from the simultaneous study of both blood and urine or by modeling intermetabolite relationships are summarized. We also discuss methodologic questions related to the study of metabolite concentrations in urine as well as among CKD patients. In summary, genome-wide association analyses of metabolites using metabolite concentrations quantified from blood and/or urine are a promising avenue of research to illuminate physiological and pathophysiological functions of the kidney.},

  abstract = {Background: All thinking occurs in some sort of context, rendering the relation between context and clinical reasoning a matter of significant interest. Context, however, has a notoriously vague and contested meaning. A profound disagreement exists between different research traditions studying clinical reasoning in how context is understood. However, empirical evidence examining the impact (or not) of context on clinical reasoning cannot be interpreted without reference to the meaning ascribed to context. Such meaning is invariably determined by assumptions concerning the nature of knowledge and knowing. The epistemology of clinical reasoning determines in essence how context is conceptualised. Aims: Our intention is to provide a sound epistemological framework of clinical reasoning that puts context into perspective and demonstrates how context is understood and researched in relation to clinical reasoning. Discussion: We identify three main epistemological dimensions of clinical reasoning research, each of them corresponding to fundamental patterns of knowing: the representational dimension views clinical reasoning as an act of categorisation, the interactional dimension as a cognitive state emergent from the interactions in a system, while the interpretative dimension as an act of intersubjectivity and socialisation. We discuss the main theories of clinical reasoning under each dimension and consider how the implicit epistemological assumptions of these theories determine the way context is conceptualised. These different conceptualisations of context carry important implications for the phenomenon of context specificity and for learning of clinical reasoning. Conclusion: The study of context may be viewed as the study of the epistemology of clinical reasoning. Making sense of ‘what is going on with this patient’ necessitates reading the context in which the encounter is unfolding and deliberating a path of response justified in that specific context. Mastery of the context in this respect becomes a core activity of medical practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Standardized end-of-clerkship examinations typically occur on the last day of the clerkship. However, recent trends toward time-varying competencybased medical education have offered students more test scheduling flexibility, creating an opportunity to study the impact of student-selected examination timing. Method: Starting with the graduating class of 2018, students took the required standardized end-of-core clerkship examinations at any available time they chose during their clinical years. Before this change, these examinations were administered to all students on the last day of the clerkship. Students' examination dates relative to clerkship completion were analyzed between 2017 and 2020 (inclusive of before and after flexible exam timing) to assess the impact that student-selected exam timing had on test performance on National Board of Medical Examiners shelf clinical science examinations for required core clerkships. Results: Data on 146 medical students in 2017 (fixed exam timing) and 466 medical students between 2018 and 2020 (flexible exam timing) were included. Among students offered flexible exam timing, between 2.7\% (internal medicine) and 14.6\% (psychiatry) took their exam before actually taking clerkship, while between 22.7\% (psychiatry) and 40.0\% (surgery) took their exam more than 90 days after the clerkship ended. Exam scores were statistically higher for those who took the exam at a time of their choosing compared with those who were required to take it at the end of individual rotations and when the exam scores were combined (fixed exam timing mean = 73.9, standard deviation [SD] = 7.8; flexible exam timing mean = 77.4, SD = 6.0, P {$<$} .001). The percent of students with passing scores was statistically higher in internal medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Conclusions: Self-selection of shelf exam timing appears to increase shelf exam scores. As more medical schools transition to competency-based medical education, providing scheduling flexibility appears not to negatively affect student achievement.},

  abstract = {Problem The COVID-19 pandemic and the spread of related health misinformation, especially on social media, have highlighted the need for more health care professionals to produce and share accurate health information to improve health and health literacy. Yet, few programs address this problem by training health care professionals in the art of science writing and medical journalism. Approach Created in 2011, the Stanford Global Health Media Fellowship aims to train medical students and residents in public communication strategies. Each year, 1 physician-in-training is selected to complete the fellowship, which includes 3 rotations: (1) 1 academic quarter at Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism, (2) 3 to 5 months with a national news network (previously NBC and ABC, now CNN), and (3) a placement at an international site. During the year-long program, fellows also complete a capstone project tackling a global health equity issue. Outcomes Since 2011, 10 fellows have completed the program, and they have acquired skills in reporting, writing, multimedia, social media, and medical communications. During the news network rotation, they have completed more than 200 medical news pieces and improved the quality of the health information in a myriad of other pieces. Alumni have continued to write and report on medical stories throughout residency, other fellowships, and as practicing physicians. One alumnus is now a medical news producer at CNN. Next Steps Expanding high-quality training in medical journalism for physicians through partnerships with journalism schools; communications departments; and local, national, and international journalists can greatly improve physicians' ability to communicate with the public. It also has the potential to greatly improve the health information the public receives. Educators should consider embedding mass health communications training in medical education curricula and increasing opportunities for physicians to engage with diverse public audiences.},

  abstract = {Purpose Case-based collaborative learning (CBCL) is a novel small-group approach that borrows from team-based learning principles and incorporates elements of problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning. CBCL includes a preclass readiness assurance process and case-based in-class activities in which students respond to focused, open-ended questions individually, discuss their answers in groups of 4, and then reach consensus in larger groups of 16. This study introduces CBCL and assesses its effectiveness in one course at Harvard Medical School. Method In a 2013 randomized controlled trial, 64 medical and dental student volunteers were assigned randomly to one of four 8-person PBL tutorial groups (control; n = 32) or one of two 16-person CBCL tutorial groups (experimental condition; n = 32) as part of a required first-year physiology course. Outcomes for the PBL and CBCL groups were compared using final exam scores, student responses to a postcourse survey, and behavioral coding of portions of video-recorded class sessions. Results Overall, the course final exam scores for CBCL and PBL students were not significantly different. However, CBCL students whose mean exam performance in prior courses was below the participant median scored significantly higher than their PBL counterparts on the physiology course final exam. The most common adjectives students used to describe CBCL were "engaging," "fun," and "thought-provoking." Coding of observed behaviors indicated that individual affect was significantly higher in the CBCL groups than in the PBL groups. Conclusions CBCL is a viable, engaging, active learning method. It may particularly benefit students with lower academic performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the long-standing faculty development initiatives for improving teaching skills in the health professions, there is still a growing need for educators who are formally trained in educational theory and practice as health professions schools experience dramatic demand and growth. Graduate programs in health professions education (HPE) provide an avenue for health professions’ faculty continuing professional development to enhance their knowledge and skills for teaching and curriculum leadership roles. There has been a proliferation of certificate, master’s, and doctoral programs in HPE over the last two decades to respond to the growing need for well-prepared faculty educators and program leadership. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe current HPE doctoral programs in United States (U.S.) and Canada. Methods: The study first examined doctoral programs in HPE identified in earlier studies. Next, we searched the literature and the web to identify new doctoral programs in the U.S. and Canada that had been established between 2014, when the prior study was conducted, and 2022. We then collated and described the characteristics of these programs, highlighting their similarities and differences. Results: We identified a total of 20 doctoral programs, 17 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. Of these, 12 programs in the U.S. and 1 program in Canada were established in the last 8 years. There are many similarities and some notable differences across programs with respect to degree title, admission requirements, duration, delivery format, curriculum, and graduation requirements. Most programs are delivered in a hybrid format and the average time for completion is 4 years. Conclusions: The workforce shortage facing health professional schools presents an opportunity, or perhaps imperative, for continuing professional development in HPE through certificate, master’s, or doctoral programs. With the current exponential growth of new doctoral programs, there is a need to standardize the title, degree requirements, and further develop core competencies that guide the knowledge and skills HPE graduates are expected to have upon graduation.},

  abstract = {Purpose               In health professions education (HPE), the effect of assessments on student motivation for learning and its consequences have been largely neglected. This is problematic because assessments can hamper motivation and psychological well-being. The research questions guiding this review were: How do assessments affect student motivation for learning in HPE? What outcomes does this lead to in which contexts?                                         Method               In October 2020, the authors searched PubMed, Embase, APA PsycInfo, ERIC, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection for “assessments” AND “motivation” AND “health professions education/students.” Empirical papers or literature reviews investigating the effect of assessments on student motivation for learning in HPE using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods from January 1, 2010, to October 29, 2020, were included. The authors chose the realist synthesis method for data analysis to study the intended and unintended consequences of this complex topic. Assessments were identified as stimulating autonomous or controlled motivation using sensitizing concepts from self-determination theory and data on context–mechanism–outcome were extracted.                                         Results               Twenty-four of 15,291 articles were ultimately included. Assessments stimulating controlled motivation seemed to have negative outcomes. An example of an assessment that stimulates controlled motivation is one that focuses on factual knowledge (context), which encourages studying only for the assessment (mechanism) and results in surface learning (outcome). Assessments stimulating autonomous motivation seemed to have positive outcomes. An example of an assessment that stimulates autonomous motivation is one that is fun (context), which through active learning (mechanism) leads to higher effort and better connection with the material (outcome).                                         Conclusions               These findings indicate that students strategically learned what was expected to appear in assessments at the expense of what was needed in practice. Therefore, health professions educators should rethink their assessment philosophy and practices and introduce assessments that are relevant to professional practice and stimulate genuine interest in the content.},

Doctors need to acquire, and to keep acquiring, tremendous amounts of factual knowledge. At the same time, most doctors can probably remember one-to-one conversations from every stage of their undergraduate and postgraduate careers that helped or influenced them. Such individual teaching, supervision, coaching, or mentorship may have been the most important part of their learning. This chapter is about such encounters. To practise reflectively, doctors need emotional and intellectual trust to reflect frankly on their own work and learn continually without feeling overexposed or under excessive scrutiny. Supervision, mentoring, and coaching have the capacity to ensure that medical practice rises consistently above the uninspired, the routine, and the automatic. These provide opportunities for doctors to examine their own work safely and effectively, based on their everyday professional experience, and in a way that complements other forms of education and training.},

Vitamin D, and especially its active metabolite calcitriol, increase digestive calcium absorption—as urinary calcium excretion is directly correlated with digestive calcium absorption, vitamin D metabolites could theoretically increase calciuria and promote urinary stone formation. Nevertheless, there was, until recently, low evidence that 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels would be correlated with kidney stone formation, even if high calcitriol concentrations are frequently observed in hypercalciuric stone formers. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels have been associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, leading to a huge increase in vitamin D prescription in the general population. In parallel, an increased frequency of kidney stone episodes has been observed in prospective studies evaluating vitamin D alone or in association with calcium supplements, and epidemiological studies have identified an association between high 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and kidney stone formation in some groups of patients. Moreover, urinary calcium excretion has been shown to increase in response to vitamin D supplements, at least in some groups of kidney stone formers. It seems likely that predisposed individuals may develop hypercalciuria and kidney stones in response to vitamin D supplements.},

However, the retention factors in learning analytics practice for STEM education have not been fully reviewed and revealed. The purpose of this systematic review is to contribute to this research gap by reviewing the empirical evidence on factors affecting student persistence and retention in STEM disciplines in higher education and how these factors are measured and quantified in learning analytics practice. By analysing 59 key publications, seven factors and associated features contributing to STEM retention using learning analytics were comprehensively categorised and discussed. This study will guide future research to critically evaluate the influence of each factor and evaluate relationships among factors and the feature selection process to enrich STEM retention studies using learning analytics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cultural competence resides at the core of undergraduate and postgraduate medical and health professional education. The evolution of studies on cultural competence has resulted in the existence of multiple theoretical frameworks and models, each emphasising certain elements of culturally appropriate care, but generally lacking in providing a coherent and systematic approach to teaching this subject. METHODS: Following a meta-ethnographic approach, a systematic search of five databases was undertaken to identify relevant articles published between 1990 and 2022. After citation searching and abstract and full article screening, a consensus was reached on 59 articles for final inclusion. Key constructs and concepts of cultural competence were synthesised and presented as themes, using the lens of critical theory. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: competences; roles and identities; structural competency. Actionable concepts and themes were incorporated into a new transformative ACT cultural model that consists of three key domains: activate consciousness, connect relations, and transform to true cultural care. CONCLUSION: This critical review provides an up-to-date synthesis of studies that conceptualise cultural competence frameworks and models in international medical and healthcare settings. The ACT cultural model provides a set of guiding principles for culturally appropriate care, to support high-quality educational interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis. The aim of this study was to detect urinary metabolic changes in gout patients which may contribute to understanding the pathological mechanism of gout and discovering potential metabolite markers. Methods. Urine samples from 35 gout patients and 29 healthy volunteers were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed to screen differential metabolites between two groups, and the variable importance for projection (VIP) values and Student’s t-test results were combined to define the significant metabolic changes caused by gout. Further, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to establish a model to distinguish gout patients from healthy people, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was made to evaluate the potential for diagnosis of gout. Result. A total of 30 characteristic metabolites were significantly different between gout patients and controls, mainly including amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, and their derivatives, associated with perturbations in purine nucleotide synthesis, amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Binary logistic regression and ROC curve analysis showed the combination of urate and isoxanthopterin can effectively discriminate the gout patients from controls with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.879. Conclusion. Thus, the urinary metabolomics study is an efficient tool for a better understanding of the metabolic changes of gout, which may support the clinical diagnosis and pathological mechanism study of gout.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing observation of asymptomatic renal calculi and identify factors associated with stone-related events. Patients and Methods: Patients with asymptomatic renal calculi electing active surveillance of their stones were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent annual ultrasonography and clinical visits with standardised questions regarding the development of symptoms or complications from calculi. Spontaneous stone passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement for intervention during follow-up were deemed as stone-related events. Results: Between 2007 and 2017, 293 patients were reviewed to evaluate the natural history of asymptomatic renal calculi. The mean follow-up was 4.2 years. Overall incidences of spontaneous passage, stone growth, development of stone-related symptoms, and requirement of intervention were 32.1\%, 16.7\%, 28.3\% and 12.3\%, respectively. Stones {$>$}5 mm and lower pole stones were significantly less likely to pass spontaneously. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperuricaemia or non-lower calyceal stone were more likely to experience stone growth. Stones {$>$}5 mm or non-lower pole stones were more likely to become symptomatic. Significant predictors of surgical intervention were stone size ({$>$}5 mm) and patients' age ({$>$}60 years). Primary therapy was extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in 33 patients and flexible ureteroscopy in three. Conclusion: The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones rarely requires intervention, although they do have a slightly higher rate of symptomatic events and growth over the intermediate term. In particular, patients with stones {$>$}5 mm, DM, hyperuricaemia, or non-lower calyceal stones are at higher risk of developing stone-related events, and should therefore be recommended for regular follow-up.},

  abstract = {Background: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a common instructional method in undergraduate health professions training. Group interactions with and within PBL curricula may influence learning outcomes, yet few studies have synthesized the existing evidence. This scoping review summarized the literature examining the influence of group function on individual student PBL outcomes. Following Kirkpatrick’s framework, experiential, academic, and behavioral outcomes were considered. The impacts of three aspects of group function were explored: (1) Group Composition (identities and diversity), (2) Group Processes (conduct and climate, motivation and confidence, and facilitation), and (3) PBL Processes (tutorial activities). Methods: A literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, and APA PsychInfo from 1980–2021, with the help of a librarian. English-language empirical studies and reviews that related group function to learning outcome, as defined, in undergraduate health professions PBL curricula were included. Relevant references from included articles were also added if eligibility criteria were met. The methods, results, discussions, and limitations of the sample were summarized narratively. Results: The final sample (n = 48) varied greatly in context, design, and results. Most studies examined junior medical students (n = 32), used questionnaires for data collection (n = 29), and reported immediate cross-sectional outcomes (n = 34). Group Processes was the most frequently examined aspect of group function (n = 29), followed by Group Composition (n = 26) and PBL Processes (n = 12). The relationships between group function and outcomes were not consistent across studies. PBL experiences were generally highly rated, but favorable student experiences were not reliable indicators of better academic or behavioral outcomes. Conversely, problematic group behaviors were not predictors of poorer grades. Common confounders of outcome measurements included exam pressure and self-study. Conclusions: The main findings of the review suggested that (1) group function is more predictive of experiential than academic or behavioral PBL outcomes, and (2) different Kirkpatrick levels of outcomes are not highly correlated to each other. More research is needed to understand the complexity of group function in PBL tutorials under variable study contexts and better inform curricular training and design. Standardized tools for measuring PBL group function may be required for more conclusive findings.},

  abstract = {Background: Use of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass COVID-19 immunisation. However, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) and an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer–BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the ChAd and BNT vaccines. Methods: Com-COV is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the UK. The majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive ChAd/ChAd, ChAd/BNT, BNT/BNT, or BNT/ChAd, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. A small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). Participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration (measured by ELISA) at 28 days after boost, when comparing ChAd/BNT with ChAd/ChAd, and BNT/ChAd with BNT/BNT. The heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5\% CI of the GMR of these comparisons was greater than 0·63. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 69254139. Findings: Between Feb 11 and Feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. The mean age of participants was 57·8 years (SD 4·7), with 212 (46\%) female participants and 117 (25\%) from ethnic minorities. At day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in ChAd/BNT recipients (12 906 ELU/mL) was non-inferior to that in ChAd/ChAd recipients (1392 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5\% CI 7·5 to ∞). In participants primed with BNT, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (BNT/ChAd, 7133 ELU/mL) against the homologous schedule (BNT/BNT, 14 080 ELU/mL), with a GMR of 0·51 (one-sided 97·5\% CI 0·43 to ∞). Four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation. Interpretation: Despite the BNT/ChAd regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (ChAd/ChAd) with proven efficacy against COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. Along with the higher immunogenicity of ChAd/BNT compared with ChAD/ChAd, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using ChAd and BNT COVID-19 vaccines.

The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients' vaccination status. RESULTS Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7\%; 95\% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7\% (95\% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0\% (95\% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5\% (95\% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0\% (95\% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. CONCLUSIONS Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.).},

Course participants and untrained matched volunteers were asked to provide instruction based on standard content material. College students served as surrogate patients. After instruction, surrogate patients completed a recall questionnaire on the standard content. Course participants exceeded controls on 10 of 16 selected teaching skills. Trained students also taught more content (p {$<$}.01), and their patients recalled more of what was taught (p {$<$}.05). Time spent teaching was not a significant covariate. Extent of use of teaching skills correlated significantly with patients’ recall (r =.57, p {$<$}.01).

  abstract = {The purpose of learning analytics is to promote student success in the classroom. To implement the framework of learning analytics, researchers have adopted machine learning methodologies to identify at-risk students at an early stage. In theory, machine learning is a mathematical al­ gorithm that improves automation through experience. The experience is the data collected from online learning platforms, and in general, the data contain various features such as the number of times that a student accesses the learning material each week. Relevant studies have demon­ strated extremely high accuracy in identifying at-risk students using identification models trained by machine learning. However, numerous details and data challenges have been overlooked in prior studies, calling into question the accuracy of past contributions. In this study, we focused on one type of data challenge: data imbalance. The data imbalance problems in education are usually the result of teachers’ grading policy. To highlight the seriousness of this issue, we collected data from 12 blended learning courses and summarized 3 types of grading policies: discrimination, stringency, and leniency. We then provided evidence that the leniency strategy causes the illusion of high accuracy of at-risk student identification. Finally, we verified a robust method to address the effectiveness of the leniency strategy, and using these results, we summarized the charac­ teristics of students who tend to be misidentified by machine learning methodology.},

  abstract = {The script concordance test (SCT) is used in health professions education to assess a specific facet of clinical reasoning competence: the ability to interpret medical information under conditions of uncertainty. Grounded in established theoretical models of knowledge organization and clinical reasoning, the SCT has three key design features: (1) respondents are faced with illdefined clinical situations and must choose between several realistic options; (2) the response format reflects the way information is processed in challenging problem-solving situations; and (3) scoring takes into account the variability of responses of experts to clinical situations. SCT scores are meant to reflect how closely respondents’ ability to interpret clinical data compares with that of experienced clinicians in a given knowledge domain. A substantial body of research supports the SCT’s construct validity, reliability, and feasibility across a variety of health science disciplines, and across the spectrum of health professions education from pre-clinical training to continuing professional development. In practice, its performance as an assessment tool depends on careful item development and diligent panel selection. This guide, intended as a primer for the uninitiated in SCT, will cover the basic tenets, theoretical underpinnings, and construction principles governing script concordance testing.},

  abstract = {Gout and hyperuricemia are highly prevalent metabolic diseases caused by high level of uric acid. Amino acids (AAs) involve in various biochemical processes including the biosynthesis of uric acid. However, the role of AAs in discriminating gout from hyperuricemia remains unknown. Here, we report that the plasma AAs profile can distinguish acute gout (AG) from asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AHU). We established an LC–MS/MS-based method to measure the plasma AAs without derivatization for the AG and AHU patients, and healthy controls. We found that the plasma profiling of AAs separated the AG patients from AHU patients and controls visually in both principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models. In addition, l-isoleucine, l-lysine, and l-alanine were suggested as the key mediators to distinguish the AG patients from AHU and control groups based on the S-plot analysis and variable importance in the projection values in the OPLS-DA models, volcano plot, and the receiver operating characteristic curves. In addition, the saturation of monosodium urate in the AA solutions at physiologically mimic status supported the changes in plasma AAs facilitating the precipitation of monosodium urate. This study suggests that l-isoleucine, l-lysine, and l-alanine could be the potential markers to distinguish the AG from AHU when the patients have similar blood levels of uric acid, providing new strategies for the prevention, treatment, and management of acute gout.},

  abstract = {Background: Lectures continue to be an efficient and standardised way to deliver information to large groups of students. It has been well documented that students prefer interactive lectures, based on active learning principles, to didactic teaching in the large group setting. Despite this, it is often the case than many students do not engage with active learning tasks and attempts at interaction. By exploring student experiences, expectations and how they use lectures in their learning we will provide recommendations for faculty to support student learning both in the lecture theatre and during personal study time. Methods: This research employed a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Three focus groups, consisting of 19 students in total, were used to explore the experiences of second year medical students in large group teaching sessions. Using generic thematic data analysis, these accounts have been developed into a meaningful account of experience. Results: This study found there to be a well-established learning culture amongst students and with it, expectations as to the format of teaching sessions. Furthermore, there were set perceptions about the student role within the learning environment which had many implications, including the way that innovative teaching methods were received. Student learning was perceived to take place outside the lecture theatre, with a large emphasis placed on creating resources that can be taken away to use in personal study time. Conclusions: Presented here is a constructive review of reasons for student participation, interaction and engagement in large group teaching sessions. Based on this are recommendations constructed with the view to aid educators in engaging students within this setting. Short term, educators can implement strategies that monopolise on the established learning culture of students to encourage engagement with active learning strategies. Long term, it would be beneficial for educators to consider ways to shift the current student learning culture to one that embraces an active learning curriculum.},

  abstract = {Background Audience response systems (ARSs) are electronic devices that allow educators to pose questions during lectures and receive immediate feedback on student knowledge. The current literature on the effectiveness of ARSs is contradictory, and their impact on student learning remains unclear. Objectives This randomised controlled trial was designed to isolate the impact of ARSs on student learning and students’ perception of ARSs during a lecture. Methods First-year medical student volunteers at Johns Hopkins were randomly assigned to either (i) watch a recorded lecture on an unfamiliar topic in which three ARS questions were embedded or (ii) watch the same lecture without the ARS questions. Immediately after the lecture on 5 June 2012, and again 2 weeks later, both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their knowledge of the lecture content and satisfaction with the learning experience. Results 92 students participated. The mean (95\% CI) initial knowledge assessment score was 7.63 (7.17 to 8.09) for the ARS group (N=45) and 6.39 (5.81 to 6.97) for the control group (N=47), p=0.001. Similarly, the second knowledge assessment mean score was 6.95 (6.38 to 7.52) for the ARS group and 5.88 (5.29 to 6.47) for the control group, p=0.001. The ARS group also reported higher levels of engagement and enjoyment. Conclusions Embedding three ARS questions within a 30 min lecture increased students’ knowledge immediately after the lecture and 2 weeks later. We hypothesise that this increase was due to forced information retrieval by students during the learning process, a form of the testing effect.},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: Future physicians will practice medicine in an increasingly complex health care system. To become effective leaders of value-based teams and to practice cost-conscious care, medical students need training in and exposure to value conscious medicine (VCM). APPROACH: A student-led initiative to enhance education in VCM led to the development of the 4-week elective course (High Value Care: in Policy and in Practice) for postclerkship third- and fourth-year students, introduced in 2021 at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The course included structured didactics, self-directed online modules, a book club, and flipped-classroom discussions in addition to clinical rotations focused on VCM in practice. OUTCOMES: Students' self-ratings of their understanding of VCM, preparation to practice value-based care, and comfort incorporating patient and system costs into clinical decisions improved after completing the course. Most indicated they would recommend the course to their peers. Suggestions for improvement included more teach-back sessions with faculty as well as more direction for preceptors to demonstrate specific aspects of VCM. NEXT STEPS: The authors share this example of a dedicated medical school VCM course as a step toward achieving the vision of integrating value into clinical decision-making and empowering students to become informed and capable future physicians. Other institutions may consider adapting this course example to prepare their students to practice VCM in an increasingly cost-focused system.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the highly selective admission processes utilised by medical schools, a significant cohort of medical students still face academic difficulties and are at a higher risk of delayed graduation or outright dismissal. Methods: This study used survival analysis to identify the non-academic and academic risk factors (and their relative risks) associated with academic difficulty at a regionally located medical school. Retrospective non-academic and academic entry data for all medical students who were enrolled at the time of the study (2009–2014) were collated and analysed. Non-academic variables included age at commencement of studies, gender, Indigenous status, origin, first in family to go to University (FIF), non-English speaking background (NESB), socio-economic status (SES) and rurality expressed as Australian Standard Geographical Classification-Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA). Academic variables included tertiary entrance exam score expressed as overall position (OP) and interview score. In addition, post-entry mid- and end-of-year summative assessment data in the first and second years of study were collated. Results: The results of the survival analysis indicated that FIF, Indigenous and very remote backgrounds, as well as low post-entry Year 1 (final) and Year 2 (mid-year and final) examination scores were strong risk factors associated with academic difficulty. A high proportion of the FIF students who experienced academic difficulty eventually failed and exited the medical program. Further exploratory research will be required to identify the specific needs of this group of students in order to develop appropriate and targeted academic support programs for them. Conclusions: This study has highlighted the need for medical schools to be proactive in establishing support interventions/strategies earlier rather than later, for students experiencing academic difficulty because, the earlier such students can be flagged, the more likely they are able to obtain positive academic outcomes.},

As of today, however, the soundness of this alternative teaching in terms of learning outcomes and students’ success is not yet clear, even though it is particularly important, since it may determine future teaching plans, strategies and methodology. This article presents the results of a teaching research project analyzing the impact of active participation and face-to-face interaction of students on their performance from a quantitative approach. Through an empirical study carried out with several groups of university students in financial accounting over a four-year period, we analyze the effect of including face-to-face techniques of participation and teaching innovation on students’ success and performance. The quantitative results indicate a significant improvement in all the indicators of the “experimental” groups, compared to face-to-face standard teaching groups and streaming teaching groups. By enhancing active participation, better marks and performance are achieved, especially in the continuous evaluation system. The qualitative results, based on the opinion of the students, also indicate their preference for models of active participation and interaction, as well as their positive perception of the success of the initiative. The advantages derived from innovative face-to-face teaching are evidenced since it favors group interaction and active participation of the students, which are crucial elements for performance and academic success.},

Online feedback assessments in physiology: effects on students' learning experiences and outcomes. formative assessments have become increasingly popular; however, formal evidence supporting their educational benefits is limited. This study investigated the impact of online feedback quizzes on the learning experiences and outcomes of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physiology course. Four quiz models were tested, which differed in the amount of credit available, the number of attempts permitted, and whether the quizzes were invigilated or unsupervised, timed or un-timed, or open or closed book. All quizzes were composed of multiple-choice questions and provided immediate individualized feedback. Summative end-of-course examination marks were analyzed with respect to performance in quizzes and were also compared with examination performance in the year before the quizzes were introduced. Online surveys were conducted to gather students' perceptions regarding the quizzes. The vast majority of students perceived online quizzes as a valuable learning tool. For all quiz models tested, there was a significant relationship between performance in quizzes and end-of-course examination scores. Importantly, students who performed poorly in quizzes were more likely to fail the examination , suggesting that formative online quizzes may be a useful tool to identify students in need of assistance. Of the four quiz models, only one quiz model was associated with a significant increase in mean examination performance. This model had the strongest formative focus, allowing multiple unsupervised and untimed attempts. This study suggests that the format of online formative assessments is critical in achieving the desired impact on student learning. Specifically , such assessments are most effective when they are low stakes. online assessment; formative assessment; summative assessment; feedback; learning outcomes ASSESSMENT IS CRUCIAL in guiding student learning and has powerful effects on both approaches to learning and learning outcomes (5, 9, 11, 15). Assessment can be classified as either formative or summative. Formative assessments are designed to provide students with relevant feedback early in the learning process to support the achievement of learning outcomes (18). In contrast, summative assessments are "higher-stakes" assessments that are primarily used to grade students at the conclusion of a study period, often without providing feedback to students on their performance (18). Formative assessments are intended to provide feedback in a nonthreatening environment, and, as such, they have traditionally had no course credit assigned to them (12, 14, 18). However, several studies (7, 8) have shown that when formative assessments are optional with no course credit assigned, there is limited use of them by students. Thus, it is becoming more popular to assign a small amount of credit to encourage students' engagement with formative assessments (8, 13). Paper-based formative assessments have a number of limitations: in particular, providing individualized feedback is time consuming and may not be feasible for large classes (21). Online formative assessments are a time-effective alternative, allowing staff to provide timely feedback to large groups of students without creating an overwhelming workload. Online formative assessments offer several potential advantages to students: they offer students more flexibility in terms of time and place and they provide immediate feedback and can provide links to learning resources thereby motivating further study (14, 21). While online formative assessments are becoming an increasingly popular supplement to traditional summa-tive examinations in higher education, formal evidence to support their educational benefits is relatively limited and often contradictory; some studies (1, 6, 14) have shown that formative assessments do not improve the learning outcomes of students, whereas others (2, 3, 8, 12, 20) have shown that they do have a positive effect on students' performance in summa-tive examinations. The University of New South Wales offers introductory undergraduate physiology courses in the second year of study. These courses are offered in two consecutive sessions, the first of which covers excitable cell physiology, muscle physiology, cardiovascular physiology, blood, and neurophysiology. The second session course covers endocrine and reproductive physiology , respiratory physiology, renal physiology, and gastroin-testinal physiology. These courses are undertaken by students enrolled in a wide range of degrees, including Science, Medical Science, Optometry, Exercise Physiology, and Engineering degrees. Given the diverse student cohort, there can be considerable variation in university entrance marks, background knowledge, and level of interest in the subject matter among our students. Student enrollments are very large: the session 1 course typically attracts between 420 and 500 students and session 2 enrollments are typically between 320 and 350 students. Although introductory, these physiology courses are comprehensive in scope, and a large proportion of students find them extremely challenging. The large student numbers and diverse student cohort pose a significant challenge to teaching staff in terms of motivating and engaging students, providing feedback on performance, and identifying and assisting students in need of remediation.},

The initiative – an international summer institute – is a four-day, professional development experience that brought together students and staff from seven countries to learn about partnership and develop specific partnership projects. Participants in the institute were invited to contribute to a qualitative study exploring their experiences of students as partners work and their perceptions of the institute’s capacity to support it. Given that much existing research on this topic tends to be celebratory, we focus here on the challenges participants ascribed to student-staff partnership, and on the features of the summer institute they thought particularly useful in helping them to navigate these difficulties. Looking beyond the summer institute, we consider the implications of these findings for those looking to support partnership more broadly.},

Just as any technological advance opens discussions about ethics, so the implications of AI for HPE ethics need to be identified, anticipated, and accommodated so that HPE can utilise AI without compromising crucial ethical principles. Rather than focussing on AI technology, this Guide focuses on the ethical issues likely to face HPE teachers and administrators as they encounter and use AI systems in their teaching environment. While many of the ethical principles may be familiar to readers in other contexts, they will be viewed in light of AI, and some unfamiliar issues will be introduced. They include data gathering, anonymity, privacy, consent, data ownership, security, bias, transparency, responsibility, autonomy, and beneficence. In the Guide, each topic explains the concept and its importance and gives some indication of how to cope with its complexities. Ideas are drawn from personal experience and the relevant literature. In most topics, further reading is suggested so that readers may further explore the concepts at their leisure. The aim is for HPE teachers and decision-makers at all levels to be alert to these issues and to take proactive action to be prepared to deal with the ethical problems and opportunities that AI usage presents to HPE.},

  abstract = {Background: Edgar Dale's Pyramid of Learning and percentages of retained learning are cited in educational literature in a range of disciplines. The sources of the Pyramid, however, are misleading. Aims: To examine the evidence supporting the Pyramid and the extent to which it is cited in medical education literature. Methods: A review of literature (1946-2012) based on a search utilising Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Medline and Google Scholar conducted from September to November 2012. Results: A total of 43 peer-reviewed medical education journal articles and conference papers were found. While some researchers had been misled by their sources, other authors' interpretations of the citations did not align with the content of those citations, had no such citations, had circular references, or consulted questionable sources. There was no agreement on the percentages of learning retention, in spite of many researchers' citing primary texts. Discussion and conclusion: The inappropriate citing of the Pyramid and its associated percentages in medical education literature is widespread and continuous. This citing undermines much of the published work, and impacts on research-based medical education literature. While the area of learning/teaching strategies and amount of retention from each is an area for future research, any reference to the Pyramid should be avoided. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.},

In order to use these technologies successfully, medical educators need to be aware of the underpinning socio-theoretical concepts that influence their usage, the pre-clinical and clinical educational environment in which the educational activities occur, and the practical possibilities and limitations of their usage. This Guide builds upon the previous AMEE Guide to e-Learning in medical education by providing medical teachers with conceptual frameworks and practical examples of using mobile technologies in medical education. The goal is to help medical teachers to use these concepts and technologies at all levels of medical education to improve the education of medical and healthcare personnel, and ultimately contribute to improved patient healthcare. This Guide begins by reviewing some of the technological changes that have occurred in recent years, and then examines the theoretical basis (both social and educational) for understanding mobile technology usage. From there, the Guide progresses through a hierarchy of institutional, teacher and learner needs, identifying issues, problems and solutions for the effective use of mobile technology in medical education. This Guide ends with a brief look to the future.},

This Guide begins by introducing the broad concepts of AI by using fairly well-known examples to illustrate AI’s implications within the context of education. It then considers the impact of AI on medicine and the implications of this impact for educators trying to educate future doctors. Drawing on these strands, it then identifies AI’s direct impact on the methodology and content of medical education, in an attempt to prepare medical educators for the changing demands and opportunities that are about to face them because of AI.},

However, it is unknown whether menopause and postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use are independent risk factors for incident kidney stone disease in women. Data from 91,731 female Nurses' Health Study participants who provided information on diet, menopause status, and kidney stone disease were used to examine the independent association between menopause and PMH use and risk of incident kidney stones. No association was found between menopause and incident kidney stones in age-adjusted (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.34) or multivariate models (RR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.41). However, when the association between the type of menopause and risk of incident kidney stones was examined, surgical menopause was associated with an increased risk in both the age-adjusted (RR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 1.77) and multivariate models (RR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.81), whereas natural menopause was not. Compared with never-use, past or current PMH use (including duration of PMH use) was not associated with incident kidney stones among postmenopausal women. In conclusion, no association was found between menopause and PMH use and incident kidney stones. Surgical menopause, however, may be associated with an increased risk.},

Existing material in PowerPoint or Keynote format is uploaded to the instructor area of Nearpod, interactive elements are added, and the lecture is then broadcasted via the internet to student devices. The lecturer may choose to share polling responses or examples of submissions from the drawing tool or open-ended questions, thereby providing instant feedback on learning. Students commented favourably on the interactivity and engagement afforded by Nearpod. Most students were happy to use their own electronic devices (smartphones, tablets and laptops) for such activities with a minority expressing concern over problems with connecting to the institutional Wi-Fi. Nearpod and similar products represent a new class of feature-rich audience response systems that have potential to transform learning even in large classes.},

In February 2020, the Federation of State Medical Boards and the National Board of Medical Examiners announced that Step 1 would transition to pass/fail scoring beginning in 2022. The authors discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of the pass/fail scoring change for underrepresented-in-medicine (UiM) trainees. UiM students may benefit from this change because it reduces the effect of an inequitable exam; helps correct for students who attend medical schools with a curriculum heavier on nontested formative elements; and decreases stress, improves quality of life, and undermines imposter syndrome. However, this change may also precipitate unforeseen challenges, such as increased discrimination toward UiM trainees, an increase in high-stakes test failures due to a reduced focus on preparing for standardized exams, or the development of new (e.g., subject exams) or overreliance on existing (e.g., school ranking) metrics that would make UiM residency candidates less competitive. To enhance UiM representation in the future health care workforce, it is imperative that national organizations (e.g., accrediting, licensing, regulatory, professional, honor, student, and faculty), hospitals, residency programs, and patient advocacy groups undertake a shared, rigorous approach in assessing the impact of the pass/fail scoring change on UiM applicants' selection to specialty and subspecialty residencies.},

Studies that evaluated any intervention to decrease diagnostic errors in any clinical setting and with any study design were eligible, provided that they addressed a patient-related outcome. Two independent reviewers extracted study data and rated study quality. There were 109 studies that addressed 1 or more intervention categories: personnel changes (n 6), educational interventions (n 11), technique (n 23), structured process changes (n 27), technology-based systems interventions (n 32), and review methods (n 38). Of 14 randomized trials, which were rated as having mostly low to moderate risk of bias, 11 reported interventions that reduced diagnostic errors. Evidence seemed strongest for technology-based systems (for example, text message alerting) and specific techniques (for example, testing equipment adaptations). Studies provided no information on harms, cost, or contextual application of interventions. Overall, the review showed a growing field of diagnostic error research and categorized and identified promising interventions that warrant evaluation in large studies across diverse settings.},

  abstract = {Objectives This article reviews and critically evaluates historical and contemporary research on simulation-based medical education (SBME). It also presents and discusses 12 features and best practices of SBME that teachers should know in order to use medical simulation technology to maximum educational benefit. Methods This qualitative synthesis of SBME research and scholarship was carried out in two stages. Firstly, we summarised the results of three SBME research reviews covering the years 1969-2003. Secondly, we performed a selective, critical review of SBME research and scholarship published during 2003-2009. Results The historical and contemporary research synthesis is reported to inform the medical education community about 12 features and best practices of SBME: (i) feedback; (ii) deliberate practice; (iii) curriculum integration; (iv) outcome measurement; (v) simulation fidelity; (vi) skill acquisition and maintenance; (vii) mastery learning; (viii) transfer to practice; (ix) team training; (x) high-stakes testing; (xi) instructor training, and (xii) educational and professional context. Each of these is discussed in the light of available evidence. The scientific quality of contemporary SBME research is much improved compared with the historical record. Conclusions Development of and research into SBME have grown and matured over the past 40 years on substantive and methodological grounds. We believe the impact and educational utility of SBME are likely to increase in the future. More thematic programmes of research are needed. Simulation-based medical education is a complex service intervention that needs to be planned and practised with attention to organisational contexts. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Clinical medical education in the 21st century is grounded in a 19th-century model that relies on longitudinal exposure to patients as the curriculum focus. The assumption is that medical students and postgraduate residents will learn from experience, that vicarious or direct involvement in patient care is the best teacher. The weight of evidence shows, however, that results from such traditional clinical education are uneven at best. Educational inertia endorsed until recently by medical school accreditation policies has maintained the clinical medical education status quo for decades. Mastery learning is a new paradigm for medical education. Basic principles of mastery learning are that educational excellence is expected and can be achieved by all learners and that little or no variation in measured outcomes will result. This Commentary describes the origins of mastery learning and presents its essential features. The Commentary then introduces the eight reports that comprise the mastery learning cluster for this issue of Academic Medicine. The reports are intended to help medical educators recognize advantages of the mastery model and begin to implement mastery learning at their own institutions. The Commentary concludes with brief statements about future directions for mastery learning program development and research in medical education.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lecture is a much used and much criticized teaching method. Lecturalgia (painful lecture) is a frequent cause of morbidity for both teachers and learners. The etiology of lecturalgia is multifactorial and multiple lecturing pathologies frequently coexist. The 'Clinical Presentation' curriculum at the University of Calgary encourages the use of 'schemes' that provide a scaffolding for learning and a starting point for approaching (clinical) problems. Thus far this approach has not been used to tackle teaching or learning problems. AIM: Our aim in this paper was to devise a schematic approach to diagnosing lecturing problems and to make evidence-based recommendations on how to resolve lecturing problems. We have suggested that causes of lecturalgia can be divided into three categories: poor judgement; poor organization; and poor delivery. Our proposed scheme is based upon these three categories that are then subcategorized. RESULTS: We have reviewed the medical education literature in an attempt to provide evidence-based recommendations for the remediation of lecturing problems within each subcategory. CONCLUSION: Where trial evidence is lacking we have made recommendations that are consistent with cognitive theory or expert opinion. Finally, where expert opinion does not exist, we have taken the liberty (literary license) of providing nonexpert opinion!},

  abstract = {Background: Simulation-based learning (SBL) has been increasingly used in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical training curricula. The aim of Simulation via Instant Messaging-Birmingham Advance (SIMBA) is to create a simple virtual learning environment to improve trainees' self-reported confidence in diabetes and Endocrinology. Methods: This study was done as part of the continuous professional development for Health Education England West Midlands speciality trainees in diabetes and Endocrinology. Standardized transcripts of anonymized real-life endocrinology (endocrine session) and diabetes cases (diabetes session) were used in the simulation model. Trainees interacted with moderators through WhatsApp® in this model. All cases were then discussed in detail by a consultant endocrinologist with reference to local, national and international guidelines. Trainee acceptance rate and improvement in their self-reported confidence levels post-simulation were assessed. Results: 70.8\% (n = 17/24) and 75\% (n = 18/24) strongly agreed the simulation session accommodated their personal learning style and the session was engaging. 66.7\% (n = 16/24) strongly felt that the simulation was worth their time. In the endocrine session, there was a significant improvement in trainees' confidence in the management of craniopharyngioma (p = 0.0179) and acromegaly (p = 0.0025). There was a trend towards improved confidence levels to manage Cushing's disease and macroprolactinoma. In diabetes session, there was a significant improvement in trainees' confidence to interpret continuous glucose monitor readings (p = 0.01). There was a trend towards improvement for managing monogenic diabetes, hypoglycaemic unawareness and interpreting Libre readings. Overall, there was a significant improvement in trainees' confidence in managing cases that were discussed post-simulation. Conclusion: SIMBA is an effective learning model to improve trainees' confidence to manage various diabetes and endocrine case scenarios. More sessions with a variety of other speciality case scenarios are needed to further assess SIMBA's effectiveness and application in other areas of medical training.},

A novel teaching method composed of Self-study, Test, Question and Discussion (STQD) sessions uses self-, peer-, co-learning, active learning, inductive teaching, and formative assessment to promote student-centered teaching in pharmacy education. STQD has been implemented within courses focusing on instrumental analysis and analytical chemistry. In a four-year study, qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to evaluate the effectiveness of STQD in facilitating students' learning. Results. Students positively evaluated their experience in STQD class with an overall mean and standard deviation of 4.35 (0.64) in a 5-point Likert scale, where a score of 1 is "strongly disagree" and a score of 5 is "strongly agree." The final examination results showed students' average score in an STQD class was higher than students' average score in a traditional class. Most students indicated that the STQD improved their learning ability, communication ability and facilitated their learning. Conclusion. The use of STQD in an integrated basic science curriculum has the potential to develop students' learning skills and improve their learning in pharmacy education.},

  abstract = {Background: Adaptive learning platforms (ALPs) can revolutionize medical education by making learning more efficient, but their potential has not been realized because students do not use them persistently. Methods: We applied educational data mining methods to study United States medical students who used an ALP called Osmosis (www.osmosis.org) from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. Multivariate logistic regressions modeled persistence on Osmosis as the dependent variable and Osmosis-collected variables as predictors. Results: The 6787 students included in our analysis responded to a total of 887,193 items, with 2138 (31.5\%) using Osmosis persistently. Number of items per student, mobile device use, subscription payment, and group membership were independently associated with persisting (p {$<$} 0.001 in all models). Persistent users rated quality more favorably (p {$<$} 0.01) but were not more confident in answer selections (p = 0.80). While persisters were more accurate than non-persisters (55\% (SD 18\%) vs 52\% (SD 22\%), p {$<$} 0.001), after adjusting for number of items, lower accuracy was associated with persistent use (OR 0.93 [95\% CI 0.90–0.97], p {$<$} 0.01).

Student–staff partnership is an approach to student engagement embracing the diverse experiences of both students and staff. Growing evidence shows significant positive outcomes for students and staff. Practice, however, is dominated by small scale initiatives, limiting opportunities for equitable engagement. In institutions where partnership has been scaled-up, little research has explored these institutional partnership schemes. Our research addresses this gap by exploring institutional approaches to partnership across 11 universities in the United Kingdom. Results provide important lessons for improving equity in access to partnership schemes and the need for broader conceptions of scaling up partnership.},

  abstract = {Background: The support of student wellbeing features highly in all higher education institutional agendas. For medical students good physical and mental health can help prevent burnout, equip students for their future healthcare setting and indirectly improve patient care. At the University of Nottingham (UK), we were keen to explore undergraduate medical students perceived wellbeing before, during, and after an early years’ (years 1-3) curriculum change. A restructure of the curriculum enabled personal wellbeing sessions to be embedded and directly linked to the pastoral support system. Methods: Students’ perceived wellbeing was assessed through a questionnaire distributed to three cohorts of first year students at the start and end of the autumn semester. Results: The data showed a clear improvement of perceived physical health at the end of the first semester following the curriculum change, alongside increased mood and ability to relax. A surprising outcome of this study was that students reported increased stress levels at the end of the semester, which we believe may be attributed to the change in assessment within the new curriculum. Our medical students are now facing end of year summative examinations, but are acutely aware of their progress as they undertake frequent formative assessments during the year. We propose that comparison of performance with peers is having a direct impact on perceived stress in these cohorts. Conclusions: The study has shown that embedding wellbeing in the curriculum can have positive effects even within a changing curriculum. The importance of evolving wellbeing provision and support based on the needs of the student population is essential and probably never more in need than at this moment in time.},

Interactive learning is more effective and may be useful in a continuing education setting. This study examines the use of an audience response system (ARS) as an interactive learning tool for health care providers. METHOD: We conducted a national randomized controlled trial to evaluate the utility of an ARS to enhance attention and learning. Speakers at 42 clinical round table (CRT) programs in five regions across the United States were randomized to "use" or "no use" of an ARS during their lectures. We surveyed participants to collect data regarding presentation and speaker quality, impressions of the ARS, and knowledge of the material presented. We collected information from speakers regarding ease of use and overall opinions of the ARS. RESULTS: A total of 283 surveys were completed (164 from participants using the ARS and 119 from participants not using the ARS). ARS participants rated the quality of the presentation, the quality of the speaker, and their level of attention more highly than non-ARS participants (p {$<$} .05). Knowledge scores (of material presented) were not significantly different between the two groups. Both participants and speakers felt that the ARS was easy to use and preferred to use the system in future CRTs. DISCUSSION: Participants in CRTs with the ARS rated presentation and speaker quality more favorably than those participants in CRTs without the tool. Participant knowledge scores, however, were not significantly different. ARSs may provide easy-to-use tools to enhance attention and enthusiasm in CME learners.},

There are many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, I provide a brief general background and focus mainly on pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single gene defects, the understanding of polygenetic causes of kidney stones is still largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An experimenter controlled form of reflection has been shown to improve the detection and correction of diagnostic errors in some situations; however, the benefits of participant-controlled reflection have not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current study is to examine how experience and a self-directed decision to reflect affect the accuracy of revised diagnoses. DESIGN: Medical residents diagnosed 16 medical cases (pass 1). Participants were then given the opportunity to reflect on each case and revise their diagnoses (pass 2). PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven medical Residents in post-graduate year (PGY) 1, 2 and 3 were recruited from Hamilton Health Care Centres. MAIN MEASURES: Diagnoses were scored as 0 (incorrect), 1 (partially correct) and 2 (correct). Accuracies and response times in pass 1 were analyzed using an ANOVA with three factors—PGY, Decision to revise yes/no, and Case 1–16, averaged across residents. The extent to which additional reflection affected accuracy was examined by analyzing only those cases that were revised, using a repeated measures ANOVA, with pass 1 or 2 as a within subject factor, and PGY and Case or Resident as a between-subject factor. KEY RESULTS: The mean score at pass 1 for each level was PGY1, 1.17 (SE 0.50); PGY2, 1.35 (SE 0.67) and PGY3, 1.27 (SE 0.94). While there was a trend for increased accuracy with level, this did not achieve significance. The number of residents at each level who revised at least one diagnosis was 12/19 PGY1 (63~\%), 9/11 PGY2 (82~\%) and 8/17 PGY3 (47~\%). Only 8~\% of diagnoses were revised resulting in a small but significant increase in scores from Pass 1 to 2, from 1.20/2 to 1.22 /2 (t = 2.15, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Participants did engage in self-directed reflection for incorrect diagnoses; however, this strategy provided minimal benefits compared to knowing the correct answer. Education strategies should be directed at improving formal and experiential knowledge.},

However, a key issue in interpreting Kolb’s model concerns a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a concrete experience, exactly. A systematic literature review was conducted in order to examine: what constitutes a concrete experience and what is the nature of treatment of a concrete experience in experiential learning? The analysis revealed five themes: learners are involved, active, participants; knowledge is situated in place and time; learners are exposed to novel experiences, which involves risk; learning demands inquiry to specific real-world problems; and critical reflection acts as a mediator of meaningful learning. Accordingly, a revision to Kolb’s model is proposed: experiential learning consists of contextually rich concrete experience, critical reflective observation, contextual-specific abstract conceptualization, and pragmatic active experimentation. Further empirical studies are required to test the model proposed.},

One of the challenges facing e-learning platforms is how to keep students motivated and engaged. Moreover, it is also crucial to identify the students that might need help in order to make sure their academic performance doesn't suffer. To that end, this paper tries to investigate the relationship between student engagement and their academic performance. Apriori association rules algorithm is used to derive a set of rules that relate student engagement to academic performance. Experimental results' analysis done using confidence and lift metrics show that a positive correlation exists between students' engagement level and their academic performance in a blended e-learning environment. In particular, it is shown that higher engagement often leads to better academic performance. This cements the previous work that linked engagement and academic performance in traditional classrooms.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Communication skills are assessed by medically-enculturated examiners using consensus frameworks which were developed with limited patient involvement. Assessments consequently risk rewarding performance which incompletely serves patients’ authentic communication needs. Whilst regulators require patient involvement in assessment, little is known about how this can be achieved. We aimed to explore patients’ perceptions of students’ communication skills, examiner feedback and potential roles for patients in assessment. Methods: Using constructivist grounded theory we performed cognitive stimulated, semi-structured interviews with patients who watched videos of student performances in communication-focused OSCE stations and read corresponding examiner feedback. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Results: A disconnect occurred between participants’ and examiners’ views of students’ communication skills. Whilst patients frequently commented on students’ use of medical terminology, examiners omitted to mention this in feedback. Patients’ judgements of students’ performances varied widely, reflecting different preferences and beliefs. Participants viewed variability as an opportunity for students to learn from diverse lived experiences. Participants perceived a variety of roles to enhance assessment authenticity. Discussion: Integrating patients into communications skills assessments could help to highlight deficiencies in students’ communication which medically-enculturated examiners may miss. Overcoming the challenges inherent to this is likely to enhance graduates’ preparedness for practice.},

Using this framework, we evaluated feedback across a 5 year undergraduate medical program to support embedding a successful learner–teacher “educational alliance”. Method: A comprehensive mapping exercise used an iterative action research process of source documentary analysis, consultations with key curriculum stakeholders and qualitative analysis. The “educational alliance” model provided a critical lens through which to ensure feedback opportunities aligned with intended learning outcomes and developmental progression. Results: Key information about the type, frequency and timing of feedback opportunities was identified within 188 curricular components. The purpose and intended learning outcomes were mapped, aligning with the stage of learning and with an expectation of supporting learners’ capacity for self-regulation. This focus providing clear articulation of feedback opportunities supported the longitudinal developmental curricular review, and facilitated enhanced awareness of dialogic feedback within the “educational alliance”. Conclusions: Explicit alignment of learning intentions between learner and educator is key to forming a successful “educational alliance”. The feedback map provides clarity ensuring mutual understanding of intended learning outcomes. The iterative process additionally certified feedback aligned with maturing learner developmental needs across the program.},

Based on Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic (VARK) scoring system the learners were grouped into unimodal and multimodal learners. There was significant improvement in post-test score among the unimodal (P{$<$}0.001) and multimodal learners (P{$<$}0.001). When the post-test score was compared between the two groups, the multimodal learners performed better the unimodal learners (P=0.018).

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess how the use of an audience response system (ARS) in medical student radiology instruction affects the self-confidence, ability to gauge mastery, and insights for future preparation in students when they participate as audience members and when they give peer teaching presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven medical students discussed radiology case files in groups and used an ARS to present their assigned cases to peers. Students' views of interactive audience response versus traditional pedagogy were surveyed using a 5-point Likert scale (1, strongly agree; 2, agree; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, disagree; 5, strongly disagree). RESULTS: Students reported that instruction with interactive ARS lectures gave them more confidence to verbally answer questions in subsequent lectures when compared to instruction with standard didactic lectures, where a presenter asks questions and a single student responds (2.35 versus 3.14, p {$<$} .024). Students found it easier to gauge their level of mastery of material by answering ARS questions than by hearing classmates' verbal responses to questions posed in lecture (1.77 versus 2.68, p {$<$} .002). When giving peer teaching presentations, students reported that the ARS lecture format helped them to gauge their audience's level of understanding (1.55, 95\% CI [1.27-1.82], p {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: Radiology instruction utilizing an ARS can help build students' confidence, knowledge of self-mastery, and insights for future studying. Similarly, student presenters using an ARS improve their confidence, better gauge their audience, and develop helpful insights for future teaching presentations.},

Within distance education (DE) students, however, research on this relationship is limited, while this group of learners is growing. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between learning strategies and academic performance in DE students. Participants were 758 students (age 19–71 years) at a distance education university in the Netherlands. An online questionnaire was used to determine learning strategies and exam grades were obtained from the university exam database to determine academic performance. Mixed model analyses showed that management of time and effort, as well as complex cognitive strategyuse were positive predictors of academic performance, whereas contact with others was a negative predictor of academic performance. Explanations for these results as well as their implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: New technologies like gamification are continuously integrated into medical education during the last years. However, the benefit and implementation of such gaming platforms are not clearly studied. This analysis assesses the feasibility of Kahoot! regarding simplicity and low-cost performance as a learning/teaching tool for medical education in (histo-)pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this feasibility pilot study, we developed 36 modules for different benign and malignant tumors, covering four major topics: gastrointestinal tract, dermatology, urogenital tract, and hematology. Each module included histomorphological text-based questions for education of 2nd-year medical students. The online gaming-platform Kahoot! was anonymously implemented before and after "classical" medical education which included discussions of histological slides for each tumor entity using Microsoft PowerPoint-based presentations in combination with microscopical demonstrations. Participating students were invited to a seven-questions evaluation about the online educational approach. RESULTS: Overall, 23 of 51 students of the study class completed the pre- and the post-evaluation of Kahoot! in one or more organ systems. The percentage of correct answers increased from the initial mean/median of 47.2/45\% to 77.2/76.3\%. Simultaneously, the time for answering questions decreased by roughly 50\% (from mean/median time of 9.1/8.3 seconds to 5.1/4.3 seconds) from pre- to post-assessment. The results were independent of gender; however, there were scoring differences between the different organ systems. Students positively evaluated the routine implementation of the gaming-platform Kahoot! within medical education. CONCLUSION: Kahoot! is as a simple, direct, and low-cost application in medical teaching improving learning outcomes of pathomorphological topics with high acceptance by students. Kahoot!-based evaluations should be also performed in more advanced topics in the field of histopathology.},

Students in the competent SRL profile demonstrated the highest levels of academic self-concept, motivation, attitude, and the lowest level of test anxiety and best academic performance. Multinomial logistic regression analysis also indicated that learning experience factors (teaching quality, clear goals and standards, appropriate assessment and workload) were significant predictors of SRL profile membership. The profiling of student self-regulated learning strategies resulted in enhanced understanding of the complex range of processes students employ and offered new insights into this emerging area of student learning.},

  abstract = {Objective This instalment in the series on professional assessment provides an introduction to methods of setting standards. Method A standard is a special score that serves as a boundary between those who perform well enough and those who do not. The practical steps in selecting it include: deciding on the type of standard; deciding the method for setting it; selecting the judges; holding the meeting; calculating the cutpoint, and deciding what to do afterwards. Four of the more popular methods are illustrated for both written and clinical examinations. Results The most important criteria for selecting a method for setting standards are whether it is consistent with the purpose of the test, based on expert judgement, informed by data, supported by research, transparent, and requires due diligence. The credibility of the standard will rely largely on the nature of the standard setters and the selection of a broadly representative and knowledgeable group is essential. After the standard has been set, it is important to ensure that stakeholders view the results as credible and that the pass rates have sensible relationships with other markers of competence. Conclusions A standard is an expression of professional values in the context of a test’s purpose and content, the ability of the examinees, and the wider social or educational setting. Because standards are an expression of values, methods for setting them are systematic ways of gathering value judgements, reaching consensus and expressing that consensus as a single score on a test.},

  abstract = {Learning in a clinical context is foundational in the training of health professionals; there is simply no alternative. The subject of the clinical learning environment (CLE) is at the forefront of discussions. In this introduction to a themed issue on the CLE, we present an expanded conceptual model that approaches the CLE through six different lenses, termed "avenues:" architectural, digital, diversity and inclusion, education, psychological, and sociocultural, with each avenue represented by a paper. The aim is to facilitate dialog around the contributions of different academic disciplines to research on the CLE. Collectively the papers highlight the overlap between the various "avenues" in how they influence each other, and how they collectively have shaped the work to understand and improve the CLE. The expectation is that the various avenues can add to existing knowledge and create new ideas for interventions to improve the clinical learning environment across nations for learners and teachers with the ultimate aim of improving patient care. Research and efforts to improve the CLE are critical to learning, professional socialization and well-being for trainees as they learn and participate in patient care, and to the quality of care they will deliver over decades of practice after graduation.},

  abstract = {Context There is a growing literature on diagnostic errors. The consensus of this literature is that most errors are cognitive and result from the application of one or more cognitive biases. Such biased reasoning is usually associated with 'System 1' (non-analytic, pattern recognition) thinking. Methods We review this literature and bring in evidence from two other fields: research on clinical reasoning, and research in psychology on 'dual-process' models of thinking. We then synthesise the evidence from these fields exploring possible causes of error and potential solutions. Results We identify that, in fact, there is very little evidence to associate diagnostic errors with System 1 (non-analytical) reasoning. By contrast, studies of dual processing show that experts are as likely to commit errors when they are attempting to be systematic and analytical. We then examine the effectiveness of various approaches to reducing errors. We point out that educational strategies aimed at explaining cognitive biases are unlikely to succeed because of limited transfer. Conversely, there is an accumulation of evidence that interventions directed at specifically encouraging both analytical and non-analytical reasoning have been shown to result in small, but consistent, improvements in accuracy. Conclusions Diagnostic errors are not simply a consequence of cognitive biases or over-reliance on one kind of thinking. They result from multiple causes and are associated with both analytical and non-analytical reasoning. Limited evidence suggests that strategies directed at encouraging both kinds of reasoning will lead to limited gains in accuracy. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Diagnostic errors are thought to arise from cognitive biases associated with System 1 reasoning, which is rapid and unconscious. The primary hypothesis of this study was that the instruction to be slow and thorough will have no advantage in diagnostic accuracy over the instruction to proceed rapidly. METHOD: Participants were second-year residents who volunteered after they had taken the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) Qualifying Examination Part II. Participants were tested at three Canadian medical schools (McMaster, Ottawa, and McGill) in 2010 (n = 96) and 2011 (n = 108). The intervention consisted of 20 computer-based internal medicine cases, with instructions either (1) to be as quick as possible but not make mistakes (the Speed cohort, 2010), or (2) to be careful, thorough, and reflective (the Reflect cohort, 2011). The authors examined accuracy scores on the 20 cases, time taken to diagnose cases, and MCC examination performance. RESULTS: Overall accuracy in the Speed condition was 44.5\%, and in the Reflect condition was 45.0\%; this was not significant. The Speed cohort took an average of 69 seconds per case versus 89 seconds for the Reflect cohort (P {$<$} .001). In both cohorts, cases diagnosed incorrectly took an average of 17 seconds longer than cases diagnosed correctly. Diagnostic accuracy was moderately correlated with performance on both written and problem-solving components of the MCC licensure examination and inversely correlated with time. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that simply encouraging slowing down and increasing attention to analytical thinking is insufficient to increase diagnostic accuracy.},

Methods: A cross sectional study of preclinical students with 74 male and 72 female (n= 146) was performed. The validated VARK questionnaire was used to categorize the learning styles of students. The questionnaire consists of 16 items which identify four different learning styles: visual, aural, reading/writing and kinesthetic. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the learning styles of students. Results: The response rate was 70\%. The results showed that 5.5\%, 11.6\%, 2.1 \%, and 8.2\% of students only preferred the visual, aural, reading/writing and kinesthetic modes, respectively. A further analysis showed that 72.6\% of students preferred multiple learning styles. Conclusions: The results of this study can provide useful information for improving the quality of the teaching and learning experiences of students.

  abstract = {Introduction: Professionalism is an evolving, socioculturally informed multidimensional construct that influences doctor-patient relationships, patient satisfaction and care outcomes. However, despite its clinical significance there is little consistency in how professionalism is nurtured amongst medical students. To address this gap a systemic scoping review of nurturing professionalism in medical schools, is proposed. Methods: Levac’s framework and the PRISMA-P 2015 checklist underpinned a 6-stage systematic review protocol. Concurrent use of Braun and Clarke’s approach to thematic analysis and directed content analysis was used to identify the key elements in nurturing professionalism. Results: 13921 abstracts were identified from six databases, 854 full-text articles reviewed, and 162 full-text included articles were included. The 4 themes identified through thematic analysis are consistent with findings of the directed content analysis. These were the definition of professionalism, the approaches, content, barriers and enablers to teaching professionalism. Conclusion: Informed by a viable definition of professionalism and clear milestones nurturing professionalism nurturing professionalism begins with culturally appropriate training in clinical competence, humanistic qualities and reflective capacity. This process requires effective evaluations of professional identity formation, and the impact of the learning environment underlining the need for longitudinal assessments of the training process.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reflections of gamification activities that are used as a formative assessment tool based on academic achievement and student engagement in learning environments. It was also aimed to investigate whether the utilization of the gamification tool led to a difference in academic achievement and student engagement. Three research groups were determined; two experimental groups where 7E instructional model gamified with Kahoot and Quizizz was implemented and a control group where conventional 7E instruction method was implemented. The groups were determined by random assignment of 97 pre-service teachers who took scientific research methods course in the 2017–2018 academic year spring semester. However, since only 71 of the assigned pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the study, the study data included 71 pre-service teachers. At the beginning and the end of the six-week-long instruction activities, the academic achievement test and student engagement scale on the content instructed in the six-week-long scientific research methods course were applied. Furthermore, in-depth views of pre-service teachers were obtained with focus group interviews. Therefore, the study was conducted with mixed design principles. The study findings demonstrated that the scientific research methods academic achievement x student engagement × group interaction model (Wilks's lambda = .819, F[2, 66] = 7.301, p {$<$} 0.05) was significant. The activities gamified with Kahoot application, albeit statistically insignificant, had a more positive impact on academic achievement and student engagement when compared to the other groups. On the other hand, it was observed that the positive impact of the activities gamified with Quizizz application was lower than that of the instruction method utilized in the control group both based on academic achievement (Δxp̄ retest-posttestquizizz = 38.116, Δxp̄ retest-posttestcontrol = 38.776) and student engagement (Δxp̄ retest-posttestquizizz = 12.176, Δxp̄ retest-posttestcontrol = 14.218). Opposed to quantitative findings, pre-service teachers expressed views about the problems they experienced under the sub themes of motivation, reinforcement, entertainment, competition sub-themes in gamification activities and stated that they were generally positive about the activities and experienced problems related to the infrastructure and the tool.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Self-determination theory postulates that the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness have to be satisfied for students to achieve intrinsic motivation and internalisation of autonomous self-regulation towards academic activities. Consequently, the influence of the clinical teaching environment becomes crucial when satisfying these needs, particularly when promoting or diminishing students’ intrinsic motivation. The aim of this study was to describe and understand how clinical teachers encourage intrinsic motivation in undergraduate dental students based on the three basic psychological needs described by the self-determination theory. Methods: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, and data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine experienced undergraduate clinical teachers of one dental school in Santiago, Chile. Interview transcripts were analysed by two independent reviewers using a general inductive approach. Findings: Several themes emerged outlining teaching strategies and behaviours. These themes included the control of external motivators; gradual transference of responsibility; identification and encouragement of personal interests; timely and constructive feedback; delivery of a vicarious learning experience; teamwork, team discussion, and presence of a safe environment, amongst others. Overall, teachers stressed the relevance of empowering, supporting and building a horizontal relationship with students. Conclusions: Our findings regarding dental education expand on the research outcomes from other health professions about how teachers may support students to internalise behaviours. An autonomy-supportive environment may lead students to value and engage in academic activities and eventually foster the use of an autonomysupportive style to motivate their patients.},

Our aim was to determine whether a cognitive forcing tool can reduce the rates of error in clinical decision making. A secondary objective was to understand the process by which this effect might occur. We hypothesised that using a cognitive forcing tool would reduce diagnostic error rates. To test this hypothesis, a novel online case-based approach was used to conduct a single blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from January 2017 to September 2018. In addition, a qualitative series of “think aloud” interviews were conducted with 20 doctors from a UK teaching hospital in 2018. The primary outcome was the diagnostic error rate when solving bias inducing clinical vignettes. A volunteer sample of medical professionals from across the UK, Republic of Ireland and North America. They ranged in seniority from medical student to Attending Physician. Seventy six participants were included in the study. The data showed doctors of all grades routinely made errors related to cognitive bias. There was no difference in error rates between groups (mean 2.8 cases correct in intervention vs 3.1 in control group, 95\% CI -0.94 – 0.45 P\,=\,0.49). The qualitative protocol revealed that the cognitive forcing strategy was well received and a produced a subjectively positive impact on doctors’ accuracy and thoughtfulness in clinical cases. The quantitative data failed to show an improvement in accuracy despite a positive qualitative experience. There is insufficient evidence to recommend this tool in clinical practice, however the qualitative data suggests such an approach has some merit and face validity to users.},

Intercorrelations, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc tests, and 2-group comparisons following rank ordering, were conducted. Results: During each of 4 testing blocks, more than 85\% of students took advantage of the self-testing process for a total of 7042 attempts. A consistent significant correlation (p\#0.05) existed between the number of practice quiz attempts and the subsequent examination scores. No difference in the number of quiz attempts was demonstrated compared to the first testing block. Exam scores for the first and second testing blocks were both higher than those for third and fourth blocks. Conclusion: Although self-testing strategies increase retrieval and retention, they are uncommon in pharmacy education. The results suggested that the number of self-testing attempts alone improved subsequent examination scores, regardless of the score for self-tests.},

We also assessed the ability of metabolites to discriminate between coffee consumption categories. This is a cross-sectional analysis of 1664 participants from the PREDIMED study. Metabolites were semiquantitatively profiled using a multiplatform approach. Consumption of total coffee, caffeinated coffee and decaffeinated coffee was assessed by using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We assessed associations between 387 metabolite levels with total, caffeinated, or decaffeinated coffee consumption (≥50 mL coffee/day) using elastic net regression analysis. Ten-fold cross-validation analyses were used to estimate the discriminative accuracy of metabolites for total and subtypes of coffee. We identified different sets of metabolites associated with total coffee, caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption. These metabolites consisted of lipid species (e.g., sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine) or were derived from glycolysis (alpha-glycerophosphate) and polyphenol metabolism (hippurate). Other metabolites included caffeine, 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, cotinine, kynurenic acid, glycocholate, lactate, and allantoin. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.60 (95\% CI 0.56-0.64), 0.78 (95\% CI 0.75-0.81) and 0.52 (95\% CI 0.49-0.55), in the multimetabolite model, for total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee consumption, respectively.

TBL is very different from problem-based learning (PBL) and other small group approaches in that there is no need for multiple faculty or rooms, students must come prepared to sessions, and individual and small groups of students (teams) are highly accountable for their contributions to team productivity. The instructor must be a content-expert, but need not have any experience or expertise in group process to conduct a successful TBL session. Students do not need any specific instruction in teamwork since they learn how to be collaborative and productive in the process. TBL can replace or complement a lecture-based course or curriculum. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined. RESULTS Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22\%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50\% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95\% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50\% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73\% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment remains uncertain, but identification of prognostic markers may help guide effective management. (Funded by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.).},

However, PjBL involves complex processes requiring higher-order thinking skills, which may pose challenges to many students especially in online settings with little prompt support from teachers. The problem may compromise the learning of low-achieving students, who often have inadequate higher-order thinking skills. Visible thinking approaches have the potential to make higher-order thinking processes accessible to students. This study was conducted with 72 university students who engaged in visible thinking supported online PjBL of computer programming. A one-group pretest-posttest design was adopted to compare the learning outcomes among high-, medium- and low-achieving students. The results showed that compared to high and medium achievers, low-achieving students made the most progress in product quality and thinking skills (in particular process design skills). They performed almost as well as medium and high achievers in product quality and process design skills at the end of the study. They also gained more knowledge from the project than high achievers did. Moreover, compared to medium achievers, low achievers perceived the approach as more valuable, made more effort on the study, and felt more competent in completing the project. The findings reveal the promising effects of visualizing higher-order thinking processes in narrowing the achievement gap between high and low achievers, offering all students an equal chance to engage in effective learning with projects.},

  abstract = {Background: Higher education students have positive attitudes about the use of audience response systems (ARS), but even technology-enhanced lessons can become tiresome if the pedagogical approach is exactly the same with each implementation. Gamification is the notion that gaming mechanics can be applied to routine activities. In this study, TurningPoint (TP) ARS interactions were gamified and implemented in 22 large group medical microbiology lectures throughout an integrated year 1 osteopathic medical school curriculum. Methods: A 32-item questionnaire was used to measure students' perceptions of the gamified TP interactions at the end of their first year. The survey instrument generated both Likert scale and open-ended response data that addressed game design and variety, engagement and learning features, use of TP questions after class, and any value of lecture capture technology for reviewing these interactive presentations. The Chi Square Test was used to analyze grouped responses to Likert scale questions. Responses to open-ended prompts were categorized using open-coding. Results: Ninety-one students out of 106 (86 \%) responded to the survey. A significant majority of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the games were engaging, and an effective learning tool. The questionnaire investigated the degree to which specific features of these interactions were engaging (nine items) and promoted learning (seven items). The most highly ranked engagement aspects were peer competition and focus on the activity (tied for highest ranking), and the most highly ranked learning aspect was applying theoretical knowledge to clinical scenarios. Another notable item was the variety of interactions, which ranked in the top three in both the engagement and learning categories. Open-ended comments shed light on how students use TP questions for exam preparation, and revealed engaging and non-engaging attributes of these interactive sessions for students who review them via lecture capture. Conclusions: Students clearly valued the engagement and learning aspects of gamified TP interactions. The overwhelming majority of students surveyed in this study were engaged by the variety of TP games, and gained an interest in microbiology. The methods described in this study may be useful for other educators wishing to expand the utility of ARS in their classrooms.},

Audience response systems (ARS) with wireless keypad technology facilitate interactive learning and have been used successfully in the education of health professionals. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the effect of an ARS on the knowledge retention of veterinary dermatology students and to survey student attitudes concerning its use. A cohort-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of ARS for short-term and long-term knowledge retention. Students also participated in four hours of student-directed case simulations using ARS technology. Students were surveyed regarding opinions on the use of the ARS. The mean short-term knowledge-retention test scores of groups A (ARS+) and B (ARS-) were 81\% and 78\%, respectively. The mean long-term knowledge-retention test scores of groups A and B were 54\% and 55\%, respectively. The differences between groups were not significant for either time period (p = 0.32, p = 0.77). Although benefits to short-term and long-term knowledge retention were not detected in this pilot study, all students responding to the survey perceived a benefit and supported the use of ARS in the clinical veterinary curriculum. ARS technology provides a tool for lecturers to create an interactive learning environment well suited for teaching veterinary dermatology.},

  abstract = {Background: In 2010, coincident with the 100th anniversary of Flexner's sentinel report, the Carnegie Foundation published an updated review of North American medical education and challenged medical schools to initiate further educational reforms. Specific recommendations pertained to a) ensuring standardized outcomes while allowing for individualized processes, b) integrating foundational knowledge with clinical experience, c) cultivating habits of inquiry and innovation and d) professional identity formation. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of this latest report, we sought to determine what type of curricular revisions have been emerging within the past decade and what types of challenges have been encountered along the way? Methods: In 2018, an electronic survey was sent to all 166 Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredited North American Medical Schools, using the points of contact (educational deans) that were listed in a publicly available, Association of American Medical Colleges database. Free text comments were grouped into themes using the constant-comparative technique. Results: Sixty unique responses yielding a 36.14\% response rate. The distribution of responses was proportionally representative of the distribution of public vs. private, old vs. new vs. established North American medical schools. Self-reported curricular changes aggregated into five main themes: Changes in curricular structure/organization, changes in curricular content, changes in curricular delivery, changes in assessment, and changes involving increased use of technology/informatics. Challenges were predominantly focused on overcoming faculty resistance, faculty development, securing adequate resourcing, change management, and competition for limited amounts of curricular time. Conclusions: Changes in curricular organization, content, delivery, assessment and the use of technology reflect reforms that are broad and deep. Empowering faculty to "let go" of familiar constructs/processes requires strong leadership, particularly when initiating particularly disruptive curricular changes, such as relocating the Step 1 examination or shifting to a competency-based curriculum. While North American medical schools are responding to the calls for action described in the second (2010) Carnegie Foundation report, the full vision has yet to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Discussion surrounding the role of the humanities as an important analytic epistemology within medical education is generally less robust than literature supporting its value in building empathy and promoting personal reflection and wellness. As such, the humanities have not been considered to be as relevant when teaching medical reasoning or technical skills. Yet, might the humanities offer value in emboldening the analytic thinking of medical learners? This article proposes an integrative conceptual model that links the thought process defining medicine - clinical reasoning - with humanistic analysis in an effort to advance the argument that the humanities offer a complementary and innovative platform that can be used within traditional medical education. The article then discusses preliminary findings from a pilot curriculum based on this model, implemented during internal medicine morning report at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. Preliminary qualitative analysis of transcripts from the pilot curriculum demonstrates that a thought process analogous to that of clinical reasoning can be identified within guided group analyses of humanities works. Participants simultaneously used thought processes that were analytic and intuitive. The emergence of ambiguity/intuition as a theme in the pilot curriculum suggests the humanities could be a powerful tool for exploring and embracing ambiguity in clinical practice. Through the development of an integrative conceptual model, this article helps to demonstrate more explicitly the theoretical link between the reasoning pathways of the humanities and clinical medicine. Though a refined curriculum and more rigorous analysis are needed before arguing for the incorporation of the humanities into traditional graduate medical education on a larger scale, the preliminary findings here support the feasibility and promise of a curriculum based on the proposed integrative conceptual model.},

We examined menopause and the risk of incident kidney stones, and changes in 24-hour urine composition in the NHS (Nurses’ Health Study) II. Materials and Methods: Using multivariate adjusted Cox proportional hazards models we prospectively analyzed 108,639 NHS II participants who provided information on menopause and kidney stones. We also analyzed 24-hour urine collections from 658 participants who performed a collection while premenopausal and a repeat collection after menopause. Results: During 22 years of followup there were 3,456 incident kidney stones. The multivariate adjusted relative risk of an incident kidney stone in postmenopausal participants compared with premenopause was 1.27 (95\% CI 1.08–1.46). On stratified analysis compared with premenopause the multivariate adjusted relative risk of natural and surgically induced menopause was 1.27 (95\% CI 1.09–1.48) and 1.43 (95\% CI 1.19–1.73), respectively. Among the 74,505 postmenopausal participants there was a total of 1,041 incident stone events. Compared with no hormone therapy neither current nor past use was significantly associated with kidney stone risk. Compared with premenopause the postmenopausal urine collections had lower mean calcium, citrate, phosphorus and uric acid, and higher mean volume. Conclusions: Postmenopausal status is associated with a higher risk of incident kidney stones. Natural menopause and surgical menopause are independently associated with higher risk. There are small but significant differences in urine composition between premenopausal and postmenopausal urine collections.},

This study aimed to understand the effect of background variability influencing the examiners’ score agreement in OSCE’s procedural skill. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted with explanatory sequential design. OSCE examiners (n=64) in the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana (FoM-UKDW) took part to assess two videos of Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) competence to get their level of agreement by using Fleiss Kappa. One video portrayed CPR according to performance guideline, and the other portrayed CPR not according to performance guidelines. Primary survey, CPR procedure, and professional behaviour were assessed. To confirm the assessment results qualitatively, in-depth interviews were also conducted. Results: Fifty-one examiners (79.7\%) completed the assessment forms. From 18 background categories, there was a good agreement ({$>$}60\%) in: Primary survey (4 groups), CPR procedure (15 groups), and professional behaviour (7 groups). In-depth interviews revealed several personal factors involved in scoring decisions: 1) Examiners use different references in assessing the skills; 2) Examiners use different ways in weighting competence; 3) The first impression might affect the examiners’ decision; and 4) Clinical practice experience drives examiners to establish a personal standard. Conclusion: This study identifies several factors of examiner background that allow better agreement of procedural section (CPR procedure) with specific assessment guidelines. We should address personal factors affecting scoring decisions found in this study in preparing faculty members as OSCE examiners.},

Adaptive expert clinicians are not only expert in their work but have the additional capacity to learn and improve in their practices. The authors review a selective aspect of learning to become an adaptive expert: the capacity to optimally balance routine approaches that maximize efficiency with innovative ones where energy and resources are used to customize actions for novel or difficult situations. Optimal transfer of learning, and hence the design of instruction, differs depending on whether the goal is efficient or innovative practice. However, the task is necessarily further complicated when the aspiration is an adaptive expert practitioner who can fluidly balance innovation with efficiency as the situation requires. Using HPE examples at both the individual and organizational level, the authors explore the instructional implications of learning to shift from efficient to innovative expert functioning, and back. They argue that the efficiency-innovation tension is likely to endure deep into the future and therefore warrants important consideration in HPE.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Assessing expertise using psychometric models usually yields a measure of ability that is difficult to generalize to the complexity of diagnoses in clinical practice. However, using an item response modeling framework, it is possible to create a decisionaligned response model that captures a clinician's decision-making behavior on a continuous scale that fully represents competing diagnostic possibilities. In this proof-of-concept study, the authors demonstrate the necessary statistical conceptualization of this model using a specific electrocardiogram (ECG) example. Method: The authors collected a range of ECGs with elevated ST segments due to either ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or pericarditis. Based on pilot data, 20 ECGs were chosen to represent a continuum from "definitely STEMI"to "definitely pericarditis,"including intermediate cases in which the diagnosis was intentionally unclear. Emergency medicine and cardiology physicians rated these ECGs on a 5-point scale ("definitely STEMI"to "definitely pericarditis"). The authors analyzed these ratings using a graded response model showing the degree to which each participant could separate the ECGs along the diagnostic continuum. The authors compared these metrics with the discharge diagnoses noted on chart review. Results: Thirty-seven participants rated the ECGs. As desired, the ECGs represented a range of phenotypes, including cases where participants were uncertain in their diagnosis. The response model showed that participants varied both in their propensity to diagnose one condition over another and in where they placed the thresholds between the 5 diagnostic categories. The most capable participants were able to meaningfully use all categories, with precise thresholds between categories. Conclusions: The authors present a decision-aligned response model that demonstrates the confusability of a particular ECG and the skill with which a clinician can distinguish 2 diagnoses along a continuum of confusability. These results have broad implications for testing and for learning to manage uncertainty in diagnosis.},

The metabolomics with a highly multiplexed and efficient manner is a challenging goal in nephrology.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: A (1) H-NMR based metabolomics approach was applied to establish a human CKD serum metabolic profile. Serum samples were obtained from CKD patients with four stages (N= 80) and healthy controls (N= 28). The data acquired by CMPG spectrum were further processed by pattern recognition (PR) analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was capable of clustering the disease groups and establishing disease-specific metabolites profile.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The classification models could grade CKD patients with considerably high value of Q(2) and R(2) . The significant endogenous metabolites that contributed to distinguish CKD in different stages included the products of glycolysis (glucose, lactate), amino acids (valine, alanine, glutamate, glycine), organic osmolytes (betaine, myo-inositol, taurine, glycerophosphcholine), and so on. Based on these metabolites, the model for diagnosing patients with CKD achieved the sensitivity and specificity of 100\%.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: The study illustrated that serum metabolic profile was altered in response to renal dysfunction and the progression of CKD. The identified metabolic biomarkers may provide useful information for the diagnosis of CKD, especially in early stages.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the medical curriculum designed to foster adaptive expertise. Engaging in the formal and informal curriculum , students learn to achieve desired outcomes in novel situations, perform comfortably with uncertainty, and are often recognized for creative problem-solving. Students learn by asking and answering their own and others' questions. They readily operate at the metacognitive level, anticipating events, self-monitoring, and checking decisions and emotions. A key function of the reflective process is to identify gaps or shortcomings in the thinking process. The adaptive learner shifts into reflective thinking when confronted with complex contextual and situational demands. We are only beginning to understand how to create educational pathways to foster adaptive learning. An essential focus is the adaptive teacher who frames learning and assessment around predictive analytics, reflective spaced practice, and authentic learning material. To be effective , the teacher must engage the learner outside the formal classroom in the parallel curriculum. A major premise is that learning occurs individually and together with peers, teachers, and team members in multiple contexts. During the learning process, the learner readily operates at the metacognitive level, anticipating behavior, self-monitoring and assessing, and checking theirs and others decisions and emotions. The adaptive medical curriculum provides the pathway for such learning.},

  abstract = {Team-based learning (TBL) is a structured form of small group learning that can be scaled up for delivery in large classes. The principles of successful TBL implementation are well established. TBL has become widely practiced in medical schools, but its use is typically limited to certain courses or parts of courses. Implementing TBL on a large scale, across different courses and disciplines, is the next logical step. The Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), a partnership between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Imperial College London, admitted its first students in 2013. This new undergraduate medical program, developed collaboratively by faculty at both institutions, uses TBL as its main learning and teaching strategy, replacing all face-to-face lectures. TBL accounts for over 60\% of the curriculum in the first two years, and there is continued learning through TBL during campus teaching in the remaining years. This paper describes our experience of rolling out TBL across all years of the medical curriculum, focusing on three success factors: (1) “team-centric” learning spaces, to foster active, collaborative learning; (2) an e-learning ecosystem, seamlessly integrated to support all phases of the TBL process and (3) teaching teams in which experts in pedagogical process (TBL Facilitators) co-teach with experts in subject matter (Content Experts).},

This article is based on half-day workshops presented at the 11th Ottawa International Conference on Medical Education in Barcelona on 5 July 2004 and the annual meeting of the Association of American Medical Colleges in Boston on 10 November 2004 as well as a review of literature. Thirteen medical faculty participated in the former and 30 in the latter. Most participants held leadership positions at their institutions and mentored trainees as well as supervised mentoring programs. The workshops reviewed skills of mentoring and strategies for designing effective mentoring programs. Participants engaged in brainstorming and interactive discussions to: (a) review different types of mentoring programs; (b) discuss measures of success and failure of mentoring relationships and programs; and (c) examine the influence of gender and cultural differences on mentoring. Participants were also asked to develop an implementation plan for a mentoring program for medical students and faculty. They had to identify student and faculty mentoring needs, and describe methods to recruit mentors as well as institutional reward systems to encourage and support mentoring.},

  abstract = {Background: Computerized decision support systems (DSS) have mainly focused on improving clinicians' diagnostic accuracy in unusual and challenging cases. However, since diagnostic omission errors may predominantly result from incomplete workup in routine clinical practice, the provision of appropriate patient- and context-specific reminders may result in greater impact on patient safety. In this experimental study, a mix of easy and difficult simulated cases were used to assess the impact of a novel diagnostic reminder system (ISABEL) on the quality of clinical decisions made by various grades of clinicians during acute assessment. Methods: Subjects of different grades (consultants, registrars, senior house officers and medical students), assessed a balanced set of 24 simulated cases on a trial website. Subjects recorded their clinical decisions for the cases (differential diagnosis, test-ordering and treatment), before and after system consultation. A panel of two pediatric consultants independently provided gold standard responses for each case, against which subjects' quality of decisions was measured. The primary outcome measure was change in the count of diagnostic errors of omission (DEO). A more sensitive assessment of the system's impact was achieved using specific quality scores; additional consultation time resulting from DSS use was also calculated. Results: 76 subjects (18 consultants, 24 registrars, 19 senior house officers and 15 students) completed a total of 751 case episodes. The mean count of DEO fell from 5.5 to 5.0 across all subjects (repeated measures ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.001); no significant interaction was seen with subject grade. Mean diagnostic quality score increased after system consultation (0.044; 95\% confidence interval 0.032, 0.054). ISABEL reminded subjects to consider at least one clinically important diagnosis in 1 in 8 case episodes, and prompted them to order an important test in 1 in 10 case episodes. Median extra time taken for DSS consultation was 1 min (IQR: 30 sec to 2 min). Conclusion: The provision of patient- and context-specific reminders has the potential to reduce diagnostic omissions across all subject grades for a range of cases. This study suggests a promising role for the use of future reminder-based DSS in the reduction of diagnostic error. © 2006 Ramnarayan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The outcomes associated with intensifying BP treatment in the hospital are poorly studied. Objectives: To characterize clinician response to BP in the hospital and at discharge and to compare short- and long-term outcomes associated with antihypertensive treatment intensification. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study took place from January 1 to December 31, 2017, with 1 year of follow-up at 10 hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic Hospitals health care system. All adults admitted to a medicine service in 2017 were evaluated for inclusion. Patients with cardiovascular diagnoses were excluded. Demographic and BP characteristics were used for propensity matching. Exposures: Acute hypertension treatment, defined as administration of an intravenous antihypertensive medication or a new class of an oral antihypertensive treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between acute hypertension treatment and subsequent inpatient acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and stroke was measured. Postdischarge outcomes included stroke and myocardial infarction within 30 days and BP control up to 1 year. Results: Among 22834 adults hospitalized for noncardiovascular diagnoses (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [17.9] years; 12 993 women [56.9\%]; 15 963 White patients [69.9\%]), 17 821 (78\%) had at least 1 hypertensive BP recorded during their admission. Of these patients, 5904 (33.1\%) were treated. A total of 8692 of 106 097 cases (8.2\%) of hypertensive systolic BPs were treated; of these, 5747 (66\%) were treated with oral medications. In a propensity-matched sample controlling for patient and BP characteristics, treated patients had higher rates of subsequent acute kidney injury (466 of 4520 [10.3\%] vs 357 of 4520 [7.9\%]; P {$<$}.001) and myocardial injury (53 of 4520 [1.2\%] vs 26 of 4520 [0.6\%]; P =.003). There was no BP interval in which treated patients had better outcomes than untreated patients. A total of 1645 of 17 821 patients (9\%) with hypertension were discharged with an intensified antihypertensive regimen. Medication intensification at discharge was not associated with better BP control in the following year. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, hypertension was common among medical inpatients, but antihypertensive treatment intensification was not. Intensification of therapy without signs of end-organ damage was associated with worse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is recommended for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Assessment of dietary intake has been limited to subjective measures and a few biomarkers from 24-h urine collections. Objective: The aim of the study was to use metabolomics to identify serum compounds that are associated with adherence to the DASH dietary pattern. Design: We conducted untargeted metabolomic profiling in serum specimens collected at the end of 8 wk following the DASH diet (n = 110), the fruit and vegetables diet (n = 111), or a control diet (n = 108) in a multicenter, randomized clinical feeding study (n = 329). Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the associations between the randomized diets and individual log-transformed metabolites after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, body mass index, and hypertension. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to identify a panel of compounds that discriminated between the dietary patterns. The area under the curve (C statistic) was calculated as the cumulative ability to distinguish between dietary patterns. We accounted for multiple comparisons with the use of the Bonferroni method (0.05 of 818 metabolites = 6.11 × 10-5). Results: Serum concentrations of 44 known metabolites differed significantly between participants randomly assigned to the DASH diet compared with both the control diet and the fruit and vegetables diet, which included an amino acid, 2 cofactors and vitamins (n = 2), and lipids (n = 41). With the use of PLS-DA, component 1 explained 29.4\% of the variance and component 2 explained 12.6\% of the variance. The 10 most influential metabolites for discriminating between the DASH and control dietary patterns were N-methylproline, stachydrine, tryptophan betaine, theobromine, 7-methylurate, chiro-inositol, 3-methylxanthine, methyl glucopyranoside, β-cryptoxanthin, and 7-methylxanthine (C statistic= 0.986). Conclusions: An untargeted metabolomic platform identified a broad array of serum metabolites that differed between the DASH diet and 2 other dietary patterns. This newly identified metabolite panel may be used to assess adherence to the DASH dietary pattern. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03403166.},

Curriculum structure and grading scales are modifiable learning environment factors that may influence student well-being. The authors sought to examine relationships among curriculum structures, grading scales, and student well-being. Method: The authors surveyed 2,056 first- and second-year medical students at seven U.S. medical schools in 2007. They used the Perceived Stress Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-8) to measure stress, burnout, and quality of life, respectively. They measured curriculum structure using hours spent in didactic, clinical, and testing experiences. Grading scales were categorized as two categories (pass/fail) versus three or more categories (e.g., honors/pass/fail). Results: Of the 2,056 students, 1,192 (58\%) responded. In multivariate analyses, students in schools using grading scales with three or more categories had higher levels of stress (beta 2.65; 95\% CI 1.54-3.76, P {$<$} .0001), emotional exhaustion (beta 5.35; 95\% CI 3.34-7.37, P {$<$} .0001), and depersonalization (beta 1.36; 95\% CI 0.53-2.19, P = .001) and were more likely to have burnout (OR 2.17; 95\% CI 1.41-3.35, P = .0005) and to have seriously considered dropping out of school (OR 2.24; 95\% CI 1.54-3.27, P {$<$} .0001) compared with students in schools using pass/fail grading. There were no relationships between time spent in didactic and clinical experiences and well-being. Conclusions: How students are evaluated has a greater impact than other aspects of curriculum structure on their well-being. Curricular reform intended to enhance student well-being should incorporate pass/fail grading. Copyright © by the Association of American Medical Colleges.},

Emotional intelligence (EI) has been positively correlated with good general communication skills and successful leadership, but there is no literature relating EI to the delivery of bad news. Purpose: Our objectives were to determine: 1) performance of first-year pediatric residents in the delivery of bad news in a standardized patient (SP) setting; and 2) the role of EI in these assessments. Our hypothesis was that pediatric trainees with higher EI would demonstrate more advanced skills in this communication task. Methods: Forty first-year residents participated. Skill in bad news delivery was assessed via SP encounters using a previously published assessment tool (GRIEV\_ING Death Notification Protocol). Residents com-pleted the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI) as a measure of EI. Results: Residents scored poorly on bad news delivery skills but scored well on EI. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability among raters using the delivering bad news assessment tool. However, no correlation was found between bad news delivery performance and EI. Conclusions: We concluded that first-year pediatric residents have inadequate skills in the delivery of bad news. In addition, our data suggest that higher EI alone is not sufficient to effectively deliver death news and more robust skill training is necessary for residents to gain competence and acquire mastery in this important communication domain.},

High school students (237 females, 128 males) from Taiwan completed surveys of their classroom motivation and the four hypothesized aspects of engagement while grades were obtained at the end of the semester. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that agentic engagement was both a distinct and an important construct, one that was associated with students’ constructive motivation, related to each of the other three aspects of engagement, and predicted independent variance in achievement. The discussion highlights the important, though currently neglected, ways that students contribute constructively into the flow of the instruction they receive, as by personalizing it and by enhancing both the lesson and the conditions under which they learn.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Summarize the published literature on team-based learning (TBL) in health professions education (HPE) using the TBL conceptual framework to identify gaps that can guide future research Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, ERIC, and Google Scholar were searched through May 2016 for English-language articles regarding the use of TBL in HPE. Reviewers independently extracted data and coded for the seven elements in Michaelsen’s Model of TBL. Results: A total of 118 articles met inclusion criteria. The number of articles published yearly on TBL has grown steadily, more than tripling between 2011 and 2016. Most studies (55; 47\%) involved undergraduate medical students and took place in the US (72; 61\%). The most commonly studied framework component was Teacher and Learner Attitudes (97; 82\%). Other commonly studied elements included Learning Outcomes (85; 72\%) and Team Characteristics (25; 21\%). Contextual Factors affecting TBL was addressed in one study. Conclusions: A substantial body of literature examines the effect that TBL has on traditional measures of achievement. However, many dimensions of TBL have not been well studied, including Teacher Decisions about TBL, Contextual Factors that affect TBL, Learners’ Engagement, and Pattern of Engagement within Teams. Future research in these areas could determine the best use of TBL in HPE.},

Using a multimethod, multilevel approach, this study examined the link between classroom emotional climate and academic achievement, including the role of student engagement as a mediator. Data were collected from 63 fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms (N = 1,399 students) and included classroom observations, student reports, and report card grades. As predicted, multilevel mediation analyses showed that the positive relationship between classroom emotional climate and grades was mediated by engagement, while controlling for teacher characteristics and observations of both the organizational and instructional climates of the classrooms. Effects were robust across grade level and student gender.

  abstract = {ESRD is a state of small-molecule disarray. We applied liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling to survey {$>$}350 small molecules in 44 fasting subjects with ESRD, before and after hemodialysis, and in 10 age-matched, at-risk fasting control subjects. At baseline, increased levels of polar analytes and decreased levels of lipid analytes characterized uremic plasma. In addition to confirming the elevation of numerous previously identified uremic toxins, we identified several additional markers of ESRD, including dicarboxylic acids (adipate, malonate, methylmalonate, and maleate), biogenic amines, nucleotide derivatives, phenols, and sphingomyelins. The pattern of lipids was notable for a universal decrease in lower-molecular-weight triacylglycerols, and an increase in several intermediate-molecular-weight triacylglycerols in ESRD compared with controls; standard measurement of total triglycerides obscured this heterogeneity. These observations suggest disturbed triglyceride catabolism and/or β-oxidation in ESRD. As expected, the hemodialysis procedure was associated with significant decreases in most polar analytes. Unexpected increases in several metabolites, however, indicated activation of a broad catabolic program, including glycolysis, lipolysis, ketosis, and nucleotide breakdown. In summary, this study demonstrates the application of metabolite profiling to identify markers of ESRD, provide perspective on uremic dyslipidemia, and broaden our understanding of the biochemical effects of hemodialysis.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review summarizes recent metabolomics studies of renal disease, outlining some of the limitations of the literature to date. RECENT FINDINGS The application of metabolomics in nephrology research has expanded from the initial analyses of uremia to include both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of earlier stages of kidney disease. Although these studies have nominated several potential markers of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD progression, a lack of overlap in metabolite coverage has limited the ability to synthesize results across groups. Furthermore, direct examination of renal metabolite handling has underscored the substantial impact kidney function has on these potential markers (and many other circulating metabolites). In experimental studies, metabolomics has been used to identify a signature of decreased mitochondrial function in diabetic nephropathy and a preference for aerobic glucose metabolism in polycystic kidney disease. In each case, these studies have outlined novel therapeutic opportunities. Finally, as a complement to the longstanding interest in renal metabolite clearance, the microbiome has been increasingly recognized as the source of many plasma metabolites, including some with potential functional relevance to CKD and its complications. SUMMARY The high-throughput, high-resolution phenotyping enabled by metabolomics technologies has begun to provide insight on renal disease in clinical, physiologic, and experimental contexts.},

These omics approaches, particularly comprehensive analysis of the genome, have catalyzed major discoveries in science and medicine, including in nephrology. However, they also generate large complex data sets that can be difficult to synthesize from a clinical perspective. This article seeks to provide an overview that makes omics technologies relevant to the practicing nephrologist, framing these tools as an extension of how we approach patient care in the clinic. More specifically, omics technologies reinforce the impact that genetic mutations can have on a range of kidney disorders, expand the catalogue of uremic molecules that accumulate in blood with kidney failure, enhance our ability to scrutinize urine beyond urinalysis for insight on renal pathology, and enable more extensive characterization of kidney tissue when a biopsy is performed. Although assay methodologies vary widely, all omics technologies share a common conceptual framework that embraces unbiased discovery at the molecular level. Ultimately, the application of these technologies seeks to elucidate a more mechanistic and individualized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The American Medical Association's Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium defined health systems science (HSS) as the study of how health care is delivered, how health care professionals work together to deliver that care, and how the health system can improve patient care and health care delivery. This framework is increasingly being incorporated into medical school curricula. Graduate medical education (GME) had previously elevated systems-based practice (SBP) as a core competency, but expectations are defined by specialty-specific milestones. The lack of a shared competency framework between undergraduate medical education (UME) and GME makes it challenging to ensure that entering residents are prepared to implement HSS/SBP concepts in the workplace. The authors explored GME faculty observations of residents exemplifying successful practice across HSS domains to inform targets for UME training and assessment. METHOD: Authors performed a single-institution qualitative study using transcribed phone interviews with eligible Vanderbilt residency program directors, associate program directors, and core faculty. Participants described observations of successful residents within each HSS domain. Two researchers independently coded, discussed, and reconciled deidentified transcripts using inductive-deductive approaches to identify themes. RESULTS: Seventeen faculty participated across specialties (17/39, 45\%). Faculty responses emphasize precurricular experiences including professional degrees, work experience, extracurriculars, and medical school exposure. Importantly, successful residents exhibit foundational core workforce characteristics including growth mindset, curiosity, and a desire to learn about systems. GME faculty identified HSS domain-specific skills, noting distinctions among learning environments. Outcomes resulting from residents' application of HSS concepts include delivering high-quality, person-centered care and systems improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Descriptions of successful practice within HSS domains highlight preparatory experiences and core workforce characteristics and outline entry-level HSS behaviors. Conceptualized in a logic model framework, these findings describe key inputs, learning activities, outputs, and outcomes for systems-prepared entering residents bridging the UME-GME transition.},

  abstract = {Background Technological advancements are rapidly changing nursing education in higher education settings. Nursing academics are enthusiastically blending technology with active learning approaches such as Team Based Learning (TBL). While the educational outcomes of TBL are well documented, the value of blending technology with TBL (blended-TBL) remains unclear. This paper presents a systematic review examining the effectiveness of blended-TBL in higher education health disciplines. Objectives This paper aimed to identify how technology has been incorporated into TBL in higher education health disciplines. It also sought to evaluate the educational outcomes of blended-TBL in terms of student learning and preference. Method A review of TBL research in Medline, CINAHL, ERIC and Embase databases was undertaken including the search terms, team based learning, nursing, health science, medical, pharmaceutical, allied health education and allied health education. Papers were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). Results The final review included 9 papers involving 2094 student participants. A variety of technologies were blended with TBL including interactive eLearning and social media. Conclusion There is limited evidence that blended-TBL improved student learning outcomes or student preference. Enthusiasm to blend technology with TBL may not be as well founded as initially thought. However, few studies explicitly examined the value of incorporating technology into TBL. There is a clear need for research that can discern the impact of technology into TBL on student preference and learning outcomes, with a particular focus on barriers to student participation with online learning components.},

Objective: To determine whether continuous infusion of hypertonic saline solution improves neurological outcome at 6 months in patients with traumatic brain injury. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in 9 intensive care units in France, including 370 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were recruited from October 2017 to August 2019. Follow-up was completed in February 2020. Interventions: Adult patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned to receive continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline solution plus standard care (n = 185) or standard care alone (controls; n = 185). The 20\% hypertonic saline solution was administered for 48 hours or longer if patients remained at risk of intracranial hypertension. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score (range, 1-8, with lower scores indicating worse functional outcome) at 6 months, obtained centrally by blinded assessors and analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (with a common odds ratio [OR] {$>$}1.0 favoring intervention). There were 12 secondary outcomes measured at multiple time points, including development of intracranial hypertension and 6-month mortality. Results: Among 370 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 [interquartile range, 27-59] years; 77 [20.2\%] women), 359 (97\%) completed the trial. The adjusted common OR for the GOS-E score at 6 months was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.47; P =.92). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 10 were not significantly different. Intracranial hypertension developed in 62 (33.7\%) patients in the intervention group and 66 (36.3\%) patients in the control group (absolute difference, -2.6\% [95\% CI, -12.3\% to 7.2\%]; OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.51-1.26]). There was no significant difference in 6-month mortality (29 [15.9\%] in the intervention group vs 37 [20.8\%] in the control group; absolute difference, -4.9\% [95\% CI, -12.8\% to 3.1\%]; hazard ratio, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.48-1.28]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, treatment with continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline compared with standard care did not result in a significantly better neurological status at 6 months. However, confidence intervals for the findings were wide, and the study may have had limited power to detect a clinically important difference.},

  abstract = {Non-alcoholic beverages are important sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds that may influence human health and increase or decrease the risk of chronic diseases. A wide variety of beverage constituents are absorbed in the gut, found in the systemic circulation and excreted in urine. They may be used as compliance markers in intervention studies or as biomarkers of intake to improve measurements of beverage consumption in cohort studies and reveal new associations with disease outcomes that may have been overlooked when using dietary questionnaires. Here, biomarkers of intake of some major non-alcoholic beverages-coffee, tea, sugar-sweetened beverages, and low-calorie-sweetened beverages-are reviewed. Results from dietary intervention studies and observational studies are reviewed and analyzed, and respective strengths and weaknesses of the various identified biomarkers discussed. A variety of compounds derived from phenolic acids, alkaloids, and terpenes were shown to be associated with coffee intake and trigonelline and cyclo(isoleucylprolyl) showed a particularly high specificity for coffee intake. Epigallocatechin and 4'-O-methylepigallocatechin appear to be the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for green or black tea, while 4-O-methylgallic acid may be used to assess black tea consumption. Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages has been assessed through the measurement of carbon-13 enrichment of whole blood or of blood alanine in North America where sugar from sugarcane or corn is used as a main ingredient. The most useful biomarkers for low-calorie-sweetened beverages are the low-calorie sweeteners themselves. Further studies are needed to validate these biomarkers in larger and independent populations and to further evaluate their specificity, reproducibility over time, and fields of application.},

E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. In diverse medical education contexts, e-learning appears to be at least as effective as traditional instructor-led methods such as lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing traditional instructor-led training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended-learning strategy. A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within medical education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage access to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization, and methods for peer review of these resources. E-learning presents numerous research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing challenges for documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The integration of e-learning into medical education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.},

  abstract = {© 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. In its early stages, symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are usually not apparent. Significant reduction of the kidney function is the first obvious sign of disease. If diagnosed early (stages 1 to 3), the progression of CKD can be altered and complications reduced. In stages 4 and 5 extensive kidney damage is observed, which usually results in end-stage renal failure. Currently, the diagnosis of CKD is made usually on the levels of blood urea and serum creatinine (sCr), however, sCr has been shown to be lacking high predictive value. Due to the development of genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, the introduction of novel techniques will allow for the identification of novel biomarkers in renal diseases. This review presents some new possible biomarkers in the diagnosis of CKD and in the prediction of outcome, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), uromodulin, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), miRNA, ncRNA, and lincRNA biomarkers and proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers. Complicated pathomechanisms of CKD development and progression require not a single marker but their combination in order to mirror all types of alterations occurring in the course of this disease. It seems that in the not so distant future, conventional markers may be exchanged for new ones, however, confirmation of their efficacy, sensitivity and specificity as well as the reduction of analysis costs are required.},

  abstract = {Background - Recognition of myocardial ischemia is critical both for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and the selection and evaluation of therapy. Recent advances in proteomic and metabolic profiling technologies may offer the possibility of identifying novel biomarkers and pathways activated in myocardial ischemia. Methods and Results - Blood samples were obtained before and after exercise stress testing from 36 patients, 18 of whom demonstrated inducible ischemia (cases) and 18 of whom did not (controls). Plasma was fractionated by liquid chromatography, and profiling of analytes was performed with a high-sensitivity electrospray triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer under selected reaction monitoring conditions. Lactic acid and metabolites involved in skeletal muscle AMP catabolism increased after exercise in both cases and controls. In contrast, there was significant discordant regulation of multiple metabolites that either increased or decreased in cases but remained unchanged in controls. Functional pathway trend analysis with the use of novel software revealed that 6 members of the citric acid pathway were among the 23 most changed metabolites in cases (adjusted P=0.04). Furthermore, changes in 6 metabolites, including citric acid, differentiated cases from controls with a high degree of accuracy (P{$<$}0.0001; cross-validated c-statistic=0.83). Conclusions - We report the novel application of metabolomics to acute myocardial ischemia, in which we identified novel biomarkers of ischemia, and from pathway trend analysis, coordinate changes in groups of functionally related metabolites. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

The field of genomics is rapidly developing toward single-cell analysis, and major advances in proteomics and metabolomics have been made in recent years. The developments on wearables and electronic health records are poised to change clinical trial design. This rise of ‘big data’ holds the promise to transform not only research progress, but also clinical decision making towards precision medicine. To have a true impact, it requires integrative and multi-disciplinary approaches that blend experimental, clinical and computational expertise across multiple institutions. Cancer research has been at the forefront of the progress in such large-scale initiatives, so-called ‘big science,’ with an emphasis on precision medicine, and various other areas are quickly catching up. Nephrology is arguably lagging behind, and hence these are exciting times to start (or redirect) a research career to leverage these developments in nephrology. In this review, we summarize advances in big data generation, computational analysis, and big science initiatives, with a special focus on applications to nephrology.},

METHODS: This study was conducted during the hematology block on year three students. Five lectures were delivered online only. Asynchronous discussion boards were created where students could interact with colleagues and instructors. A flipped classroom was introduced with application exercises. Summative assessment results were compared with previous year results as a historical control for statistical significance. Student feedback regarding their blended learning experience was collected. RESULTS: A total of 127 responses were obtained. Approximately 22.8\% students felt all lectures should be delivered through didactic lecturing, while almost 35\% felt that 20\% of total lectures should be given online. Students expressed satisfaction with blended learning as a new and effective learning approach. The majority of students reported blended learning was helpful for exam preparation and concept clarification. However, a comparison of grades did not show a statistically significant increase in the academic performance of students taught via the blended learning method. CONCLUSIONS: Learning experiences can be enriched by adopting a blended method of instruction at various stages of undergraduate and postgraduate education. Our results suggest that blended learning, a relatively new concept in Saudi Arabia, shows promising results with higher student satisfaction. Flipped classrooms replace passive lecturing with active student-centered learning that enhances critical thinking and application, including information retention.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Team-based learning (TBL) is a highly structured, instructive, and student-focused pedagogy used by medical educators to foster the students’ learning. The present study aimed to qualitatively explore the students’ perception of the effectiveness of online synchronous TBL pedagogical strategy in promoting learning outcomes. Methods: A cross-over interventional study was conducted on MD4 year medical students, using four modified TBL sessions on common immunological diseases on four different dates. 139 participants were divided into 4 groups [35 each in A, B, C, \& 34 in D]. For TBL session 1, Group A and group B were the study and control groups, respectively. For the second session on different topics, the groups were reversed with group B and group A as the study and control groups, respectively. The same was followed for groups C and D. The means and standard deviations of the pre-test and post-test scores were compared after calculating the improvement in scores from pre-to post-tests. Repeated measures ANOVA suitably coded in SPSS for cross-over design was used to find out confounding by sequence of interventions with a p-value of {$<$}0.05 signifying the significance. Students’ feedback on online TBL sessions was collected through a predesigned questionnaire on a 3-point Likert scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 and expressed as number and percentage. Results: The post-test scores of the students who participated in the TBL session were significantly higher when compared to the self-study (SS) arm. The overall improvement in scores was 4.98 (1.4) in TBL group, whereas in the SS arm it was only 2.29 (1.51). The new method was found far superior to the self-study method regardless of being applied before or after the comparison mode of self-study (P{$<$}0.0001). The scores of the self-study was marginally better when offered first rather than after a TBL session, indicating the negative effect of cross-over on SS mode (P=0.024). The overall response of our students toward the effectiveness of online TBL pedagogy was overwhelmingly positive in terms of an opinion survey which had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.932. The majority ({$>$}80\%) perceived TBL as an enjoyable active session that promoted their active participation and engagement through student-led discussions. Many stated that TBL enhanced their critical thinking, problem-solving ability, communication skills, and knowledge. Conclusion: TBL is an instructive and highly structured teaching-learning strategy, welcomed by the majority of our participants. Online TBL sessions are effective in fostering the students’ learning and can be used confidently when needed.},

Although the benefits of collaborative learning have long been recognized, it is still rarely studied by social network analysis (SNA) in medical education, and the relationship of parameters that can be obtained via SNA with students' performance remains largely unknown. The aim of this work was to assess the potential of SNA for studying online collaborative clinical case discussions in a medical course and to find out which activities correlate with better performance and help predict final grade or explain variance in performance. Methods: Interaction data were extracted from the learning management system (LMS) forum module of the Surgery course in Qassim University, College of Medicine. The data were analyzed using social network analysis. The analysis included visual as well as a statistical analysis. Correlation with students' performance was calculated, and automatic linear regression was used to predict students' performance. Results: By using social network analysis, we were able to analyze a large number of interactions in online collaborative discussions and gain an overall insight of the course social structure, track the knowledge flow and the interaction patterns, as well as identify the active participants and the prominent discussion moderators. When augmented with calculated network parameters, SNA offered an accurate view of the course network, each user's position, and level of connectedness. Results from correlation coefficients, linear regression, and logistic regression indicated that a student's position and role in information relay in online case discussions, combined with the strength of that student's network (social capital), can be used as predictors of performance in relevant settings. Conclusion: By using social network analysis, researchers can analyze the social structure of an online course and reveal important information about students' and teachers' interactions that can be valuable in guiding teachers, improve students' engagement, and contribute to learning analytics insights.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is found to affect the mental health of the population. Undergraduate medical students are especially prone to mental health disorders and hence could be more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 217 undergraduate medical students in a medical college at Chennai, India. Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were recorded using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Items (DASS21) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in India in December 2019 and June 2020, respectively. In the follow-up survey, in addition to DASS21, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 related stressors were used. The selfadministered questionnaire assessed the status of COVID-19 testing, interactions with COVID-19 patients, self-perceived levels of concerns and worries related to academics (COVID-19-AA (academic apprehensions)) and those pertaining to the self and family/friends (COVID-19-GA (general apprehensions)). Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of overall scores of depression, anxiety, and stress and scores stratified by gender, year of study, place of residence and monthly family income were performed. Predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 were investigated using adjusted binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio with 95\% confidence interval (CI). A P value {$<$} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The average scores of depression, anxiety, and stress during the baseline survey were 7.55 ± 7.86, 4.6 ± 6.19 and 7.31 ± 7.34 with the prevalence (95\% Cl) of 33.2\% [27-39.9\%], 21.2\% [16-27.2\%] and 20.7\% [15.5-26.7\%]; in follow-up survey, the mean scores were 8.16 ± 8.9, 6.11 ± 7.13 and 9.31 ± 8.18 with the prevalence being 35.5\% [29.1-42.2\%], 33.2\% [27-39.9\%] and 24.9\% [19.3-31.2\%] for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress (P {$<$} 0.001), with depression remaining unchanged during COVID-19, irrespective of gender, year of study, place of residence and family's monthly income. Poor sleep quality, higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, higher COVID-19-GA, COVID-19 patients in family/friends and direct interactions with COVID-19 patients were found to be significant predictors of negative mental health in undergraduate medical students. COVID-19-AA was not significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic appears to negatively affect the mental health of the undergraduate medical students with the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress being increased, and depression symptoms remaining unaltered. Addressing and mitigating the negative effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of this population is crucial.},

Vaccines that elicit protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses that circulate in animals have the potential to prevent future pandemics. Here we show that the immunization of macaques with nanoparticles conjugated with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, and adjuvanted with 3M-052 and alum, elicits cross-neutralizing antibody responses against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants). Vaccination of macaques with these nanoparticles resulted in a 50\% inhibitory reciprocal serum dilution (ID50) neutralization titre of 47,216 (geometric mean) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric receptor-binding domain also induced cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, albeit at lower titres than achieved with the nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that current mRNA-based vaccines may provide some protection from future outbreaks of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, and provide a multimeric protein~platform for the further development of vaccines against multiple (or all) betacoronaviruses.},

  abstract = {Renal stone disease is a frequent condition, causing a huge burden on health care systems globally. Calcium-based calculi account for around 75\% of renal stone disease and the incidence of these calculi is increasing, suggesting environmental and dietary factors are acting upon a preexisting genetic background. The familial nature and significant heritability of stone disease is known, and recent genetic studies have successfully identified genes that may be involved in renal stone formation. The detection of monogenic causes of renal stone disease has been made more feasible by the use of high-Throughput sequencing technologies and has also facilitated the discovery of novel monogenic causes of stone disease. However, the majority of calcium stone formers remain of undetermined genotype. Genomewide association studies and candidate gene studies implicate a series of genes involved in renal tubular handling of lithogenic substrates, such as calcium, oxalate, and phosphate, and of inhibitors of crystallization, such as citrate and magnesium. Additionally, expression profiling of renal tissues from stone formers provides a novel way to explore disease pathways. New animal models to explore these recently- identified mechanisms and therapeutic interventions are being tested, which hopefully will provide translational insights to stop the growing incidence of nephrolithiasis.},

  abstract = {Background: In high-stakes assessments in medical education, the decision to let a particular participant pass or fail has far-reaching consequences. Reliability coefficients are usually used to support the trustworthiness of assessments and their accompanying decisions. However, coefficients such as Cronbach’s Alpha do not indicate the precision with which an individual’s performance was measured. Objective: Since estimates of precision need to be aligned with the level on which inferences are made, we illustrate how to adequately report the precision of pass-fail decisions for single individuals. Method: We show how to calculate the precision of individual pass-fail decisions using Item Response Theory and illustrate that approach using a real exam. In total, 70 students sat this exam (110 items). Reliability coefficients were above recommendations for high stakes test ({$>$} 0.80). At the same time, pass-fail decisions around the cut score were expected to show low accuracy. Conclusions: Our results illustrate that the most important decisions–i.e. those based on scores near the pass-fail cut-score–are often ambiguous, and that reporting a traditional reliability coefficient is not an adequate description of the uncertainty encountered on an individual level.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the effect of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) on dental students' learning strategies and competence to manage periodontal diseases in patients. The implemented OSCE was expected to be superior to the existing Written Exam in fostering the acquisition of clinical competencies in terms of study strategies that are more oriented towards clinical practice, longer study time, greater clinical proficiency, and more realistic selfassessment. Material and methods: After a clinical course in periodontology, 72 third year dental students were assessed summatively, either using a Written Exam or an OSCE (P-OSCE). The students were informed beforehand about the assessment formats. The self-assessed clinical competence, study time and strategies (i.e. practice with a manikin, peers and patient case) were evaluated by means of a questionnaire. After a comprehensive dental care course, all 72 students were assessed by an overall end-of-year OSCE, in which three periodontal stations were included 'measuring pockets', 'educating patients' and 'tracing an X-ray with bone-loss'. The competence of the previous Written Exam group and the POSCE group was investigated by determining the mean scores and pass-fail scores of three periodontal test-stations as well as the total score of the end-of-year OSCE. The degree of realistic self-assessment was studied by correlating the self-assessed competencies as evaluated by means of the questionnaire with the total score of the end-of-year OSCE. Results: Self-assessed clinical competence, study time and study strategies showed no differences between the P-OSCE and the Written Exam-group. The clinical competence determined in the test-station 'measuring pockets' in the end of year overall OSCE was higher for the P-OSCE group (P = 0.05) when compared with the Written Exam group; the two groups performed equally well in the test station 'educating patients', whereas the performance in 'tracing an X-ray with bone-loss' was better in the Written Exam group. This group also had a higher total score in the end-of-year OSCE (P = 0.05). The degree of realistic self-assessment was higher in the P-OSCE group than in the Written Exam group: in the P-OSCE group the self-assessed clinical competencies correlated significantly with the total score of the overall end-of-year OSCE (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusions: No effects of the implementation of an OSCE in undergraduate periodontal education were observed in study strategies, but the implementation of an OSCE in undergraduate periodontal education appears to stimulate learning, resulting in greater achievement of specific clinical competence and a greater level of realistic self-assessment. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.},

  abstract = {Phenomenon: The call component of clerkship presents students with unique opportunities and challenges. Clerkship programs employ various call modalities, including traditional call, night float, and evening call. The impact of these call models on the student experience has not been explored in depth. Approach: Focus groups were conducted with 4th-year medical students, exploring their multidimensional experiences with various call modalities during clerkship. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Thirty-nine students participated in 6 focus groups. Four overarching themes were identified: (a) educational value conferred by clinical exposure and teaching, (b) maintaining quality of life and developing features of burnout, (c) formation of professional identity via relationships with team members, and (d) perceived quality of patient care provided. Students associated evening call with burnout and poor educational value but also better patient continuity of care. Night float and traditional call contributed to a sense of team bonding and had enhanced perceived educational value while on call but resulted in loss of formal academic teaching time. Insights: Call modality impacts student learning, well-being, professional identity formation, and patient care; however, trade-off among these elements exists across all call models. Enhancing the value of student call experience may be achieved by implementation of various purposeful changes. These may include creating consistency between student and resident call schedules, maximizing recovery time between call shifts, and avoiding scheduling of students for call prior to academic sessions.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives CKD is a common public health problem. Identifying biomarkers adds prognostic/diagnostic value by contributing to an understanding of CKD at the molecular level and possibly defining new drug targets. Metabolomics provides a snapshot of biochemical events at a particular time in the progression of CKD. This cross-sectional metabolomics study ascertained whether plasma metabolite profiles are significantly different in CKD stages 2, 3, and 4. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements An analysis of plasma metabolites, using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, was conducted on 30 nondiabetic men ages 40-52 years, with 10 participants each in CKD stages 2, 3, and 4 based on their estimated GFR (calculated by the Modified Diet in Renal Disease formula). Participants were recruited in late 2008, and plasma samples were tested at Metabolon Inc and analyzed in 2012. Results Comparison of stage 3/stage 2 identified 62 metabolites that differed (P≤0.05), with 39 higher and 23 lower in stage 3 compared with stage 2; comparisons of stage 4/stage 2 identified 111 metabolites, with 66 higher and 45 lower; and comparisons of stage 4/stage 3 identified 11 metabolites, with 7 higher and 4 lower. Major differences in metabolite profiles with increasing stage of CKD were observed, including altered arginine metabolism, elevated coagulation/inflammation, impaired carboxylate anion transport, and decreased adrenal steroid hormone production. Conclusions Global metabolite profiling of plasma uncovered potential biomarkers of stages of CKD. Moreover, these biomarkers provide insight into possible pathophysiologic processes that may contribute to progression of CKD. Copyright © 2013 by the American Society of Nephro.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose This study examined the early effects of a team based learning (TBL) pilot, including differences in student engagement with TBL compared to lectures, and student accountability, preferences, and satisfaction with TBL. Educational activity and setting Three TBL sessions were delivered in the nephrology section of pharmacotherapy and then students completed the team-based learning student assessment instrument (TBL-SAI), which assesses TBL relative to lecture on three subscales (i.e., student accountability, preferences, and satisfaction). Students also completed a modified engagement instrument for a lecture and again for a TBL session. Findings All students (160) participated in the survey (100\% response rate). When comparing TBL and lecture engagement, five of eight statements were statistically significantly different. In TBL, students reported the strongest agreement with statements related to contributions (i.e., contributing fair share [mean 3.97], contributing meaningfully [mean 3.96]). Using the TBL-SAI, the mean score for accountability (30.64) was higher than neutral (24) indicating a higher level of accountability with TBL. Student satisfaction with TBL was neutral (mean 26.62, neutral = 27). Discussion and conclusions In a three-session pilot, TBL had positive effects on engagement and accountability. Early positive effects could aid programs in building and maintaining momentum with the TBL approach while working towards outcomes that may take longer to achieve, such as changes in professionalism or teamwork. Duration of exposure and perseverance through the transition to TBL may be important in developing preferences and satisfaction. This study provides insights to programs and instructors about student perceptions and attitudes as TBL is introduced.},

Obese and OW patients share most of the same risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity, while the impact of being OW, rather than obese, on urinary metabolic parameters of kidney stone formers (KSF) is less well known. The aims of this study were to investigate urinary metabolic parameters, stone composition and probability of stone formation (Psf) in OW KSF when compared with normal weight (NW) and obese KSF. MethodsThe kidney stone database for KSF attending a large metabolic stone clinic was investigated. Patients with a recorded BMI, confirmed diagnosis of kidney stone disease and full metabolic evaluation were divided into three categories: BMI ≤25.0 kg/m\textsuperscript{2} (NW group), BMI 25-30 kg/m\textsuperscript{2} (OW group) and BMI {$>$}30.0 kg/m\textsuperscript{2} (obese group). Twenty-four hour urinary volume (U.Vol), pH (U.pH), calcium (U.Ca), oxalate (U.Ox), citrate (U.Cit), uric acid (U.UA), magnesium (U.Mg), sodium (U.Na) and potassium (U.K) excretions, along with stone composition and Psf, were then compared among the groups. ResultsA total of 2132 patients were studied, of whom 833 (39\%) were NW, 863 (40.5\%) were OW and 436 (20.5\%) were obese. OW and obese KSF were older (mean age 43 ± 15 in NW, 48 ± 13 in OW and 50 ± 12 years in obese; P for trend {$<$}0.001), demonstrated increased female predominance and higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and gout. There were no statistically significant differences in U.Vol and U.Mg among the groups. However, significantly higher levels of U.Ca, U.Ox, U.Cit, by crude analysis, and U.UA (3.3 ± 1.1 versus 3.8 ± 1.2 versus 4.0 ± 1.2 mmol/L; P {$<$} 0.001 for trend), U.Na (151 ± 57 versus 165 ± 60 versus 184 ± 63 mmol/L; P {$<$} 0.001 for trend), and lower U.pH (6.3 ± 0.5 versus 6.1 ± 0.5 versus 6.0 ± 0.6; P {$<$} 0.001 for trend) by both crude and multivariate adjusted analysis models were demonstrated in OW and obese KSF. Stone composition data (N = 640) showed a significantly higher incidence of uric acid stones in OW and obese groups (P for trend {$<$} 0.001). In addition, higher Psf for CaOx, UA and CaOx/UA stone types were detected in OW and obese compared with NW KSF. ConclusionsSimilar to obese KSF, OW KSF show clear alterations in metabolic urinary profiles that are associated with increased overall risk of stone formation. This greater risk is primarily due to raised U.UA and U.Na, lower U.pH and higher prevalence of hypercalciuria, along with unchanged levels of the commonly measured urinary lithogenesis inhibitors. Moreover, our study established a higher incidence of uric acid, but not calcium, stones in OW KSF. Thus, appropriate evaluation and follow-up may be warranted even in OW patients who are at risk of increased stone formation. Whether modest weight loss in OW KSF will have a favourable impact on their metabolic urinary profiles and thereby diminish the risk of further stone formation needs exploring.},

  abstract = {Background \& Objectives: To maximize the education value of medical teaching it is necessary to understand our learners' preferred mode of learning and facilitate them with the best possible way. Our objective was to assess the learning style preferences of first year MBBS students and study the influence of learning styles on gender \& academic performance. Methods: We administered Honey \& Mumford's 80-point learning style questionnaire to 150 first year medical students (87 females \& 63 boys) of our institute. We studied correlation of learning styles with gender \& academic performance with ANOVA \& Chi square tests. Results: 58\% of our students were Unimodal (single 'very strong' preference), 28\% Bimodal (two 'very strong' preferences) \& 13\% Multimodal (more than two 'very strong' preferences). 'Activist' was the most preferred style among unimodal learners \& 'Reflector/theorist' among bimodal learners. Gender differences were evident among the Unimodal vs. Bimodal/Multimodal learners. Statistically significant difference was observed within the unimodal group with reflectors as highest achievers. No significant difference in the exam grades of Unimodal, Bimodal \& Multimodal learners was evident. Conclusion: We have a diverse group of learners and understanding their learning preferences will help in catering to their learning needs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Purpose: Psychologists theorize that cognitive reasoning involves two distinct processes: System 1, which is rapid, unconscious, and contextual, and System 2, which is slow, logical, and rational. According to the literature, diagnostic errors arise primarily from System 1 reasoning, and therefore they are associated with rapid diagnosis. This study tested whether accuracy is associated with shorter or longer times to diagnosis. Method: Immediately after the 2010 administration of the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II at three test centers, the authors recruited participants, who read and diagnosed a series of 25 written cases of varying difficulty. The authors computed accuracy and response time (RT) for each case. Results: Seventy-five Canadian medical graduates (of 95 potential participants) participated. The overall correlation between RT and accuracy was -0.54; accuracy, then, was strongly associated with more rapid RT. This negative relationship with RT held for 23 of 25 cases individually and overall when the authors controlled for participants' knowledge, as judged by their MCCQE Part I and II scores. For 19 of 25 cases, accuracy on each case was positively related to experience with that specific diagnosis. A participant's performance on the test overall was significantly correlated with his or her performance on both the MCCQE Part I and II. Conclusions: These results are inconsistent with clinical reasoning models that presume that System 1 reasoning is necessarily more error prone than System 2. These results suggest instead that rapid diagnosis is accurate and relates to other measures of competence. © 2012 Association of American Medical Colleges.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate a model for considering general and specific elements of student experience in a gateway course in undergraduate Financial Accounting in a large university on the East Coast, USA. Specifically, the study evaluated a bifactor analytic strategy including a general factor of student classroom experience, conceptualized as student engagement as rooted in flow theory, as well as factors representing specific dimensions of experience. The study further evaluated the association between these general and specific factors and both student classroom practices and educational outcomes. The sample of students (N = 407) in two cohorts of the undergraduate financial accounting course participated in the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) measuring students' classroom practices, perceptions, engagement, and perceived learning throughout the one-semester course. Course grade information was also collected. Results showed that a two-level bifactor model fit the data better than two traditional (i.e., non-bifactor) models and also avoided significant multicollinearity of the traditional models. In addition to student engagement (general factor), specific dimensions of classroom experience in the bifactor model at the within-student level included intrinsic motivation, academic intensity, salience, and classroom self-esteem. At the between-student level, specific aspects included work orientation, learning orientation, classroom self-esteem, and disengagement. Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling (MSEM) demonstrated that sitting in the front of the classroom (compared to the sitting in the back), taking notes, active listening, and working on problems during class had a positive effect on within-student variation in student engagement and attention. Engagement, in turn, predicted perceived learning. With respect to between-student effects, the tendency to sit in front seats had a significant effect on student engagement, which in turn had a significant effect on perceived learning and course grades. A significant indirect relationship of seating and active learning strategies on learning and course grade as mediated by student engagement was found. Support for the general aspect of student classroom experience was interpreted with flow theory and suggested the need for additional research. Findings also suggested that active learning strategies are associated with positive learning outcomes even in educational environments where possibilities for action are relatively constrained.},

This study used video analysis to identify, operationally define, and code processes of reasoning students used while using a computer-based tool to construct causal maps. The process data was then used to conduct a path analysis to determine which and how specific processes impact the quality of students’ causal maps and to determine how students’ prior knowledge on the given problems influence which processes students use. The findings reveal that students exhibiting the tendency to use more backward than forward processing and use more breadth than depth-first processing produced higher quality causal maps, and that the influence of prior content knowledge on what processes students use are not conclusive. The findings and the methods developed in this study present new ideas on ways to integrate learning analytics into computer-based mapping tools to model and manage the cognitive processes students use to construct better cognitive maps.},

Our aims for this review are: to identity and analyze the four categories of risk factors in contributing to the global scale of stone formation: lifestyle, genetics, diet, and environment; and discuss preventative measures for kidney stone formation. We also performed data search through the published scientific literature, i.e., PubMed® and found that there is a significant link between lifestyle and obesity with cases of calcium stones. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization factor indicators for dietary intake and obesity, along with climate data were used to create the projected total risk world map model for nephrolithiasis risk. Complete global analyses of nephrolithiasis deplete of generalizations is nearly insurmountable due to limited sources of medical and demographic information, but we hope this review can provide further elucidation into confounding risk factors and preventative measures for global nephrolithiasis analysis.},

Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials. METHODS We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death. RESULTS A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200]. No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P\,=\,0.46). Overall mortality was 10.96\% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43\% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95\% CI, -7.8 to 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS No significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.

However, most of literature regarding an effective medical teacher includes student ratings or expert opinions. Furthermore, interdisciplinary studies for the same are even fewer. We did a cross-sectional study of the characteristics of effective teachers from their own perspective across medicine and dentistry disciplines. Methods: A questionnaire comprising of 24 statements relating to perceived qualities of effective teachers was prepared and used. The study population included the faculty of medicine and dentistry at the institution. Respondents were asked to mark their response to each statement based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. These statements were grouped these into four main subgroups, viz. Class room behaviour/instructional delivery, interaction with students, personal qualities and professional development, and analysed with respect to discipline, cultural background, gender and teaching experience using SPSS v 13.0. For bivariate analysis, t-test and one way ANOVA were used. Multiple linear regression for multivariate analysis was used to control confounding variables. Results: The top three desirable qualities of an effective teacher in our study were knowledge of subject, enthusiasm and communication skills. Faculty with longer teaching experienced ranked classroom behaviour/ instructional delivery higher than their less experienced counterparts. There was no difference of perspectives based on cultural background, gender or discipline (medicine and dentistry). Conclusion: This study found that the faculty perspectives were similar, regardless of the discipline, gender and cultural background. Furthermore, on review of literature similar findings are seen in studies done in allied medical and non-medical fields. These findings support common teacher training programs for the teachers of all disciplines, rather than having separate training programs exclusively for medical teachers. Logistically, this would make it much easier to arrange such programs in universities or colleges with different faculties or disciplines.},

  abstract = {Diagnostic errors are major contributors to harmful patient outcomes, yet they remain a relatively understudied and unmeasured area of patient safety. Although they are estimated to affect about 12 million Americans each year in ambulatory care settings alone, both the conceptual and pragmatic scientific foundation for their measurement is under-developed. Health care organizations do not have the tools and strategies to measure diagnostic safety and most have not integrated diagnostic error into their existing patient safety programs. Further progress toward reducing diagnostic errors will hinge on our ability to overcome measurement-related challenges. In order to lay a robust groundwork for measurement and monitoring techniques to ensure diagnostic safety, we recently developed a multifaceted framework to advance the science of measuring diagnostic errors (The Safer Dx framework). In this paper, we describe how the framework serves as a conceptual foundation for system-wide safety measurement, monitoring and improvement of diagnostic error. The framework accounts for the complex adaptive sociotechnical system in which diagnosis takes place (the structure), the distributed process dimensions in which diagnoses evolve beyond the doctor's visit (the process) and the outcomes of a correct and timely "safe diagnosis" as well as patient and health care outcomes (the outcomes). We posit that the Safer Dx framework can be used by a variety of stakeholders including researchers, clinicians, health care organizations and policymakers, to stimulate both retrospective and more proactive measurement of diagnostic errors. The feedback and learning that would result will help develop subsequent interventions that lead to safer diagnosis, improved value of health care delivery and improved patient outcomes.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently prioritized patient safety areas in primary care, and included diagnostic errors as a high-priority problem. In addition, a recent report from the Institute of Medicine in the USA, ' Improving Diagnosis in Health Care', concluded that most people will likely experience a diagnostic error in their lifetime. In this narrative review, we discuss the global significance, burden and contributory factors related to diagnostic errors in primary care. We synthesize available literature to discuss the types of presenting symptoms and conditions most commonly affected. We then summarize interventions based on available data and suggest next steps to reduce the global burden of diagnostic errors. Research suggests that we are unlikely to find a ' magic bullet' and confirms the need for a multifaceted approach to understand and address the many systems and cognitive issues involved in diagnostic error. Because errors involve many common conditions and are prevalent across all countries, the WHO's leadership at a global level will be instrumental to address the problem. Based on our review, we recommend that the WHO consider bringing together primary care leaders, practicing frontline clinicians, safety experts, policymakers, the health IT community, medical education and accreditation organizations, researchers from multiple disciplines, patient advocates, and funding bodies among others, to address the many common challenges and opportunities to reduce diagnostic error. This could lead to prioritization of practice changes needed to improve primary care as well as setting research priorities for intervention development to reduce diagnostic error.},

In terms of internal dynamics, emotional components of engagement contributed significantly to changes in their behavioral counterparts; feedback from behavior to changes in emotion were not as consistent. Teacher support and students' self-perceptions (especially autonomy) contributed to changes in behavioral components: Each predicted increases in engagement and decreases in disaffection. Tests of process models revealed that the effects of teacher context were mediated by children's self-perceptions. Taken together, these findings suggest a clear distinction between indicators and facilitators of engagement and begin to articulate the dynamics between emotion and behavior that take place inside engagement and the motivational dynamics that take place outside of engagement, involving the social context, self-systems, and engagement itself.},

In terms of internal dynamics, emotional components of engagement contributed significantly to changes in their behavioral counterparts; feedback from behavior to changes in emotion were not as consistent. Teacher support and students' self-perceptions (especially autonomy) contributed to changes in behavioral components: Each predicted increases in engagement and decreases in disaffection. Tests of process models revealed that the effects of teacher context were mediated by children's self-perceptions. Taken together, these findings suggest a clear distinction between indicators and facilitators of engagement and begin to articulate the dynamics between emotion and behavior that take place inside engagement and the motivational dynamics that take place outside of engagement, involving the social context, self-systems, and engagement itself. © 2008 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES Many medical schools are currently undergoing curriculum reform. When considering the means by which students will be evaluated in a revised curriculum, the need to reduce the prevalences of depression and anxiety associated with academic stress must be weighed against the importance of academic outcomes. Pass/fail evaluation, as compared with tiered grading, is commonly presented as a means to adequately assess student performance while minimising stress and anxiety. The purpose of this literature review was to determine the impact of pass/fail grading on medical student well-being and academic outcomes. METHODS A systematic search was performed of the available literature published between January 1980 and August 2010, using the PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO and ERIC databases. Eligible papers assessed the impact of pass/fail grading on medical student well-being, academic outcomes or both. Academic outcomes included but were not limited to objective measures, such as performance on the US Medical Licensing Examination, and subjective measures, such as student desirability by residency programmes. Reference lists in identified papers were searched and all identified papers were run through a citation index. RESULTS Four papers met the inclusion criteria for both well-being and academic outcomes. An additional five papers met the inclusion criteria for academic outcomes only. The four papers that focused on well-being reported improvement in specified areas. No significant difference was identified in any of the five papers examining objective academic outcomes or in those papers that examined the quality of residency programmes attained. Results from two studies suggested that some programme directors believe pass/fail grading creates disadvantages for students in attaining a residency, whereas a third study yielded mixed results about its impact on residency attainment. CONCLUSIONS Student well-being is enhanced and objective academic performance is not adversely affected by a pass/fail evaluation system, but students' ability to obtain a desired residency programme may be hindered by individual programme directors' preferences for tiered grading systems. There is an overall paucity of literature on this topic and additional study is needed. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2011.},

To understand this cohort’s traits or behaviors and know how to support this generation are key to the effectiveness of teaching, learning and collaboration with other generations. This study therefore aimed at discovering the personality traits of Gen Z undergraduates in Thailand by employing a mixed-method design. The participants in the study comprised 400 Gen Z undergraduate students at a university in Bangkok, Thailand. They were asked to respond to a questionnaire on a 4-point Likert’s scale, which was developed based on the Big Five model (Goldberg, 1976) consisting of the 5 dimensions of personality: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Tech-addiction has been proposed as another dimension of the model due to the prevalence of technology and social media at the present time. Likewise, a focus group interview with 5 students and semi-structured interviews with 4 EFL teachers were conducted. The findings revealed that of the six-personality dimensions, agreeableness was rated at the highest level whereas neuroticism was rated lowest. The personality traits of Gen Z seem to challenge educators in terms of classroom management and activity design. The implications of the study may contribute to EFL classroom practice.},

Aim: The aim of this study is to explore how teachers in medical and dental education understand their role as mentors. Method: Twenty mentors in two different mentor programmes for undergraduate medical and dental students were interviewed. The transcripts were analysed using a phenomenographic approach. Results: The findings comprise three qualitatively different ways of understanding what it means to be a mentor, which are described as: (1) a mentor is someone who can answer questions and give advice, (2) a mentor is someone who shares what it means to be a doctor/dentist, and (3) a mentor is someone who listens and stimulates reflection. The way the mentors understood their role also affected what they did as mentors, their relationships with their mentees and their perceived benefits as mentors. Conclusions: Being a mentor can be perceived in qualitatively different ways also within the same mentor programme. This understanding affects the mentors" actions, their relationships with their mentees and their perceived benefits of being a mentor. Awareness of one's own understanding is important in improving practices and the findings of this study can be used by mentors, teachers and educational developers to facilitate improved effectiveness in mentor programmes, both for mentors and mentees. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.},

To our knowledge, no previous studies describe the effects that this mapping has on the curriculum.

Methods: All lecturers in the lecture series were directly observed by a minimum of two reviewers and learning objectives and the level of competence were documented. After the lecture series, the results were visualized within the catalog of learning objectives and were sent to the lecturers. In the following lecture series, learning objectives were documented correspondingly. Results: In the first lecture series, 47\% of the learning objectives were taught. After the mapping, the number of learning objectives that were taught increased to 59\% (p {$<$} 0.001). The increase was found in all surgical disciplines and in all levels of competences without any changes in the average duration of the lectures. Conclusions: The presented method for mapping a curriculum effectively increased the number of taught learning objectives without requiring longer lecture durations.},

Methods: The participants were OSCE examiners and third-year medical students. This prospective study was conducted using a multistage design. In the first step, an unstructured interrogation of the examiners formed the basis for developing a feedback tool, which was evaluated and then adopted in the next steps. Results: In total, 351 students and 51 examiners participated in this study. A baseline was created for each category of OSCE station and was supplemented with station-specific items. Each of these items was rated on a three-point scale. In addition to the preformulated answer options, each domain had space for individual comments. A total of 87.5\% of the students and 91.6\% of the examiners agreed or rather agreed that written feedback should continue to be used in upcoming OSCEs. Conclusion: The implementation of structured, written feedback in a curricular, summative examination is possible, and examiners and students would like the feedback to be constant.},

METHODS: A survey instrument was developed to assess whether and to what extent active learning was used by faculty members of US colleges and schools of pharmacy. This survey instrument was distributed via the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) mailing list. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (114) of all US colleges and schools of pharmacy were represented with at least 1 survey among the 1179 responses received. Eighty-seven percent of respondents used active-learning techniques in their classroom activities. The heavier the teaching workload the more active-learning strategies were used. Other factors correlated with higher use of active-learning strategies included younger faculty member age (inverse relationship), lower faculty member rank (inverse relationship), and departments that focused on practice, clinical and social, behavioral, and/or administrative sciences. CONCLUSIONS: Active learning has been embraced by pharmacy educators and is used to some extent by the majority of US colleges and schools of pharmacy. Future research should focus on how active-learning methods can be used most effectively within pharmacy education, how it can gain even broader acceptance throughout the academy, and how the effect of active learning on programmatic outcomes can be better documented.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Self-regulated learning (SRL) can enhance students’ learning process. Students need support to effectively regulate their learning. However, the effect of learning climate on SRL behavior, its ultimate effect on learning and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been established. We explored these relationships using self-determination theory. Materials and methods: Nursing students (N ¼ 244) filled in questionnaires about SRL behavior, perceived learning, perceived pedagogical atmosphere and Basic Psychological Needs (BPN) satisfaction after their clinical placement. Structural equation modelling was used to test a model in which perceived pedagogical atmosphere affects SRL behavior and subsequent perceived learning through BPN satisfaction. Results: The tested model had an adequate fit (RMSEA ¼ 0.080, SRMR ¼ 0.051; CFI ¼ 0.972; TLI ¼ 0.950). A positively perceived pedagogical atmosphere contributed to SRL behavior, which was fully explained by BPN satisfaction. SRL partially mediated the contribution of pedagogical atmosphere/BPN to perceived learning. Conclusions: A learning climate that satisfies students’ BPN contributes to their SRL behavior. SRL behavior plays a positive but modest role in the relationship between climate and perceived learning. Without a culture that is supportive of learning, implementation of tools to apply SRL behavior may not be effective. Study limitations include reliance on self-report scales and the inclusion of a single discipline.},

  abstract = {"The bestselling authors of the classic Difficult Conversations teach us how to turn evaluations, advice, criticisms, and coaching into productive listening and learning We swim in an ocean of feedback. Bosses, colleagues, customers-but also family, friends, and in-laws-they all have "suggestions" for our performance, parenting, or appearance. We know that feedback is essential for healthy relationships and professional development-but we dread it and often dismiss it. That's because receiving feedback sits at the junction of two conflicting human desires. We do want to learn and grow. And we also want to be accepted just as we are right now. Thanks for the Feedback is the first book to address this tension head on. It explains why getting feedback is so crucial yet so challenging, and offers a powerful framework to help us take on life's blizzard of off-hand comments, annual evaluations, and unsolicited advice with curiosity and grace. The business world spends billions of dollars and millions of hours each year teaching people how to give feedback more effectively. Stone and Heen argue that we've got it backwards and show us why the smart money is on educating receivers- in the workplace and in personal relationships as well. Coauthors of the international bestseller Difficult Conversations, Stone and Heen have spent the last ten years working with businesses, nonprofits, governments, and families to determine what helps us learn and what gets in our way. With humor and clarity, they blend the latest insights from neuroscience and psychology with practical, hard-headed advice. The book is destined to become a classic in the world of leadership, organizational behavior, and education"--\$\$c Provided by publisher},

METHOD: The authors completed a qualitative study through the Departments of Medicine at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine between March 2010 and January 2011. They conducted individual, semistructured interviews with faculty members from different career streams and ranks and analyzed transcripts of the interviews, drawing on grounded theory. RESULTS: The authors completed interviews with 54 faculty members and identified a number of themes, including the characteristics of effective mentors and mentees, actions of effective mentors, characteristics of successful and failed mentoring relationships, and tactics for successful mentoring relationships. Successful mentoring relationships were characterized by reciprocity, mutual respect, clear expectations, personal connection, and shared values. Failed mentoring relationships were characterized by poor communication, lack of commitment, personality differences, perceived (or real) competition, conflicts of interest, and the mentor's lack of experience. CONCLUSIONS: Successful mentorship is vital to career success and satisfaction for both mentors and mentees. Yet challenges continue to inhibit faculty members from receiving effective mentorship. Given the importance of mentorship on faculty members' careers, future studies must address the association between a failed mentoring relationship and a faculty member's career success, how to assess different approaches to mediating failed mentoring relationships, and how to evaluate strategies for effective mentorship throughout a faculty member's career.},

Unfortunately, adoption of longitudinal clinical reasoning curricula is still infrequent. This study explores the barriers that hinder the explicit teaching of clinical reasoning from a new international perspective. Methods: The context of this study was a European project whose aim is to develop a longitudinal clinical reasoning curriculum. We collected data in semi-structured interviews with responders from several European countries who represent various health professions and have different backgrounds, roles and experience. We performed a qualitative content analysis of the gathered data and constructed a coding frame using a combined deductive/inductive approach. The identified themes were validated by parallel coding and in group discussions among project members. Results: A total of 29 respondents from five European countries participated in the interviews; the majority of them represent medicine and nursing sciences. We grouped the identified barriers into eight general themes: Time, Culture, Motivation, Clinical Reasoning as a Concept, Teaching, Assessment, Infrastructure and Others. Subthemes included issues with discussing errors and providing feedback, awareness of clinical reasoning teaching methods, and tensions between the groups of professionals involved.},

Although the concept of student–staff partnership is rapidly gaining momentum in health professions education, the current practices are more outcome-focused and pay less attention to the partnership process itself. Students’ involvement in most of the claimed partnerships has been viewed as input information to the educational design process rather than inviting them to the more pronounced role as partners. In this commentary, we elaborate on different levels of students’ involvement in educational design, before highlighting the possible dynamics between students and staff in partnership. We propose five key features of dynamics involved in the process of real student–staff partnerships and a Process-Outcome Model for Student–staff Partnership. We advocate that moving beyond outcomes and diving deeper into the partnership processes is the way forward to establishing true student–staff partnerships.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched outpatient military electronic health records from the Southwestern United States to identify adult patients with hyperlipidemia and urolithiasis. Military facilities serve active duty members, retirees, and their immediate family members. We created two predictor variables - with and without statin. The outcome variable was a diagnosis of urolithiasis. RESULTS: The inception cohort included 57,232 subjects with hyperlipidemia and 1,904 subjects with nephrolithiasis. Patients taking statin medications had significantly less stone formation compared to patients not taking statin medications (3.1\% vs. 3.7\%, univariate OR = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.76 - 0.91, p {$<$} 0.001). Statins patients were significantly older (59 vs. 45 years, p {$<$} 0.001), more likely to be female (38\% vs. 34\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and have co-morbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease; all p {$<$} 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that statin medications had a protective effect against stone formation (OR = 0.51, 95\% CI 0.46 - 0.57, p {$<$} 0.001), after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The risk of nephrolithiasis was not only additive for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity; more importantly it was attenuated with addition of statin use. CONCLUSION: Statin medications are associated with reduced risk of urinary stones. This is the first study to demonstrate the impact of statins on nephrolithiasis. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these findings that treatment of hyperlipidemia reduces stone risk formation.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251–296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20 years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

We previously reported the potential therapeutic role of osteopontin (OPN) and macrophages in CaOx kidney stone formation, discovered using genome-recombined mice and genome-wide analyses. Here, to characterize the genetic pathogenesis of RPs, we used microarrays and immunohistology to compare gene expression among renal papillary RP and non-RP tissues of 23 CaOx stone formers (SFs) (age- and sex-matched) and normal papillary tissue of seven controls. Transmission electron microscopy showed OPN and collagen expression inside and around RPs, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed that the papillary gene expression of CaOx SFs differed significantly from that of controls. Disease and function analysis of gene expression revealed activation of cellular hyperpolarization, reproductive development, and molecular transport in papillary tissue from RPs and non-RP regions of CaOx SFs. Compared with non-RP tissue, RP tissue showed upregulation ({$>$}2-fold) of LCN2, IL11, PTGS1, GPX3, and MMD and downregulation (0.5-fold) of SLC12A1 and NALCN (P{$<$}0.01). In network and toxicity analyses, these genes associated with activated mitogenactivated protein kinase, the Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and proinflammatory cytokines that cause renal injury and oxidative stress. Additionally, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, numbers of immune cells, and cellular apoptosis increased in RP tissue. This study establishes an association between genes related to renal dysfunction, proinflammation, oxidative stress, and ion transport and RP development in CaOx SFs.},

Aims: To provide an overview of mentoring in clinical and academic medicine, review the literature, discuss various mentoring styles and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of mentoring. Method: A discussion paper that describes good mentoring, promotes mentoring as a performance enhancer and gives examples to illustrate issues. It draws on available literature and introduces several novel ideas in mentoring. Results: Doctors at all career stages including medical students can benefit from mentoring. Benefits of mentoring include; benefits to the mentee, benefits to the mentor and benefits to the organization. Overall, both mentees and mentors are highly satisfied with mentoring. Nevertheless, problems exist, such as conflict between the mentoring and supervisory roles of the mentor, confidentiality breaches, mentor bias, lack of "active listening" and role confusion. Problems usually stem from poor implementation of mentoring. Mentors should not be the mentee's educational supervisor or line manager or otherwise be involved in their assessment or appraisal to avoid blurring of these distinct roles. Safeguards of confidentiality are of vital importance in maintaining the integrity of the mentoring process. Good mentoring is a facilitative, developmental and positive process which requires good interpersonal skills, adequate time, an open mind and a willingness to support the relationship. Mentors should encourage critical reflection on issues to enable mentees to find solutions to their own problems. Conclusions: Mentoring is an important developmental process for all involved. There is a perception amongst mentors and mentees that well conducted, well timed mentoring can reap enormous benefits for mentees and be useful to mentors and organizations. However strong evidence for this is lacking and there is need for further research in this area.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.Background U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear. Methods We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period. Results The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3\% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-totreat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5\%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6\%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 11.7; P=0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9\%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7\%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95\% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P{$<$}0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4\% vs. 8.6\%; difference,-5.2 percentage points; 95\% CI,-8.2 to-2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1\% vs. 10.3\%; difference,-7.2 percentage points; 95\% CI,-10.4 to-4.1), and infections in household members (1.7\% vs. 4.1\%; difference,-2.4 percentage points; 95\% CI,-4.6 to-0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4\%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4\%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2\%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group. Conclusions In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo.},

  abstract = {Background. Insulin resistance is a central feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and may increase the risk of kidney stone formation. Existing cross-sectional data on the association between DM and nephrohthiasis are limited, and no prospective study to date has evaluated the relation between DM and the risk of kidney stones. Methods. To evaluate the relation between DM and prevalent kidney stones, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 3 large cohorts including over 200,000 participants: the Nurses' Health Study I (older women), the Nurses' Health Study II (younger women), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (men). We then prospectively studied the association between DM and incident nephrohthiasis over a combined 44 years of follow-up. Because insulin resistance can precede the diagnosis of DM by decades, we also prospectively examined the relation between kidney stones and the diagnosis of incident DM. Multivariate regression models adjusted for age, body mass index, thiazide diuretic use, fluid intake, and dietary factors. Results. At baseline, the multivariate relative risk of prevalent stone disease in individuals with DM compared to individuals without was 1.38 (95\% CI 1.06-1.79) in older women, 1.67 (95\% CI 1.28-2.20) in younger women, and 1.31 (95\% CI 1.11-1.54) in men. Prospectively, the multivariate relative risk of incident kidney stone formation in participants with DM compared to participants without was 1.29 (95\% CI 1.05-1.58) in older women, 1.60 (95\% CI 1.16-2.21) in younger women, and 0.81 (95\% CI 0.59-1.09) in men. The multivariate relative risk of incident DM in participants with a history of kidney stones compared to participants without was 1.33 (95\% CI 1.18-1.50) in older women, 1.48 (95\% CI 1.14-1.91) in younger women, and 1.49 (95\% CI 1.29-1.72) in men. Conclusion. DM is a risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Additional studies are needed to determine if the increased risk of DM in stone formers is due to subclinical insulin resistance. © 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology.},

  abstract = {Context Larger body size may result in increased urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, and uric acid, thereby increasing the risk for calcium-containing kidney stones. It is unclear if obesity increases the risk of stone formation, and it is not known if weight gain influences risk. Objective To determine if weight, weight gain, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference are associated with kidney stone formation. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective study of 3 large cohorts: the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N=45988 men; age range at baseline, 40-75 years), the Nurses’ Health Study I (N=93758 older women; age range at baseline, 34-59 years), and the Nurses’ Health Study II (N=101877 younger women; age range at baseline, 27-44 years). Main Outcome Measures Incidence of symptomatic kidney stones. Results We documented 4827 incident kidney stones over a combined 46 years of follow-up. After adjusting for age, dietary factors, fluid intake, and thiazide use, the relative risk (RR) for stone formation in men weighing more than 220 lb (100.0 kg) vs men less than 150 lb (68.2 kg) was 1.44 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.86; P=.002 for trend). In older and younger women, RRs for these weight categories were 1.89 (95\% CI, 1.52-2.36; P .001 for trend) and 1.92 (95\% CI, 1.59-2.31; P .001 for trend), respectively. The RR in men who gained more than 35 lb (15.9 kg) since age 21 years vs men whose weight did not change was 1.39 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.70; P=.001 for trend). Corresponding RRs for the same categories of weight gain since age 18 years in older and younger women were 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.40-2.05; P .001 for trend) and 1.82 (95\% CI, 1.50-2.21; P .001 for trend). Body mass index was associated with the risk of kidney stone formation: the RR for men with a BMI of 30 or greater vs those with a BMI of 21 to 22.9 was 1.33 (95\% CI, 1.08-1.63; P .001 for trend). Corresponding RRs for the same categories of BMI in older and younger women were 1.90 (95\% CI, 1.61-2.25; P .001 for trend) and 2.09 (95\% CI, 1.77-2.48; P .001 for trend). Waist circumference was also positively associated with risk in men (P=.002 for trend) and in older and younger women (P .001 for trend for both). Conclusions Obesity and weight gain increase the risk of kidney stone formation. The magnitude of the increased risk may be greater in women than in men.},

  abstract = {Problem As medical students become residents, teaching becomes an expected and integral responsibility. Yet, training-for-teaching opportunities are lacking. In 2014, the authors designed a pilot study using rubric-guided, focused, personalized coaching sessions and video-recorded presentations to improve student teaching skills among fourth-year students at Harvard Medical School. Approach In 2014–2015, the authors recruited students from an elective on how to tutor preclinical students for the pilot, which consisted of four phases: a precoaching teaching presentation, a 30- to 45-minute coaching session, a postcoaching teaching presentation, and blinded reviewer ratings. Students’ pre- and postcoaching presentations were video recorded. Using a scoring rubric for 15 teaching skills, students rated their pre- and postcoaching videos. Blinded reviewers also rated the pre- and postcoaching presentations using the same rubric with an additional category to gauge their overall impression. Outcomes Fourteen students completed all four phases of the pilot. Students’ ratings demonstrated statistically significant improvement in several teaching skills, including presentation content (P {$<$} .001), rate of speech (P = .001), and opening statement and learning objectives (P = .004). Blinded reviewers’ ratings demonstrated statistically significant improvements in several teaching skills, including opening statement and learning objectives (P {$<$} .001), overall impression (P = .001), and conclusion and summary of learning objectives (P = .004). Students provided largely positive comments on the interventions. Next Steps The authors will work toward addressing limitations in the rubric, using coaching in different teaching settings, addressing the interventions’ generalizability, training coaches, and performing additional evaluations.},

  abstract = {Purpose:Until 1996, there were only 7 masters-level programs in health professions education (HPE); currently, there are 76 such programs. The purpose of this article is to provide information and perspectives about the available masters programs in HPE worldwide, with a focus on their mission, objectives, content, instructional strategies, format, duration, and cost, as well as the similarities and differences among them. Method:A literature and web search was conducted to develop a complete list of programs that offer a masters degree in HPE or closely related areas. Results:Forty three percent [43\% (33)] of these programs are in Europe, 20\% (15) in North America, 17\% (13) in Asia, 7\% (5) in Latin America, 5\% (4) in the Middle East, 5\% (4) in Australia, and 3\% (2) in Africa. The mission of these masters programs is to prepare leaders in HPE or sometimes narrowly focusing on clinical or dental education. The content is addressed in core courses and electives, generally grouped under the following headings: curriculum development, instructional methods/teaching and learning, assessment strategies, program evaluation, research design, and sometimes leadership and management. Medical schools sponsor approximately two-thirds of these programs, and the average duration for completion is 2 years. The vast majority of these programs are offered in English. Conclusion:The commonalities among these programs include focus, content, and educational requirements. The variations are mostly in organization and structure. There is a need to establish criteria and mechanisms for evaluation of these programs. The geographic maldistribution of these programs is a major concern. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under control. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association that the virus will establish with the human population and, in particular, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease. Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fuelled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection and re-entries from zoonotic reservoirs. Here we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity. Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2. There are key pieces of data that are urgently needed in order to make good decisions; we outline these and propose a way forward.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} The increasingly complex patient care in the twenty-first century is delivered by interprofessional health care teams. Interprofessional collaboration can be taught during interprofessional education. However, whether a long-term change in collaborative competencies can be achieved by interprofessional education has not been studied sufficiently. Our research questions were: How does motivation for interprofessional collaboration and interprofessional collaborative skills change up to one year after an interprofessional educational intervention? How are they related to each other? Methods\enspace{} During a one-year period, undergraduate medical and nursing students attended four interprofessional (intervention) or uniprofessional (control group) education sessions. Self-determination Theory was used as the theoretical framework. Autonomous and controlled motivation scores for interprofessional collaboration were calculated using the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire, before (T1), directly after (T2) and one year post-intervention (T3). At T3, the students also filled out the Interprofessional Collaborative Competencies Attainment Survey (ICCAS), which measured the perceived attainment of collaborative competencies by a retrospective pre-test/post-test design. We used linear mixed effects models to analyse the motivation scores and linear regression for the relation between motivation and competence. Results\enspace{} In the interprofessional group, autonomous motivation scores of the participants were significantly lower at T2 vs. T1. Controlled motivation scores were significantly higher at T3 vs. T1. Controlled motivation scores for T2 were significantly higher in the uniprofessional group than in the interprofessional group. Perceived competence was related to higher autonomous motivation scores. At T3 the interprofessional collaborative competencies seemed to have grown more among students in the interprofessional group. Conclusions\enspace{} The perceived growth in interprofessional collaboration competence lasted at least up to one year after the intervention, and was measurable with the ICCAS. The growth was significantly more in the IPE students},

But today, countries and leaders are increasingly adopting antihumanistic policies and positions. In this Invited Commentary, the author probes whether humanism in medicine can survive in the current culture. The author defines humanism as any system or mode of thought or action in which human interests, values, and dignity predominate. He traces humanism as a philosophical and political movement from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment to the development of liberal democracies in the 20th century. He identifies the humanistic roots of the medical profession and describes efforts to revitalize humanism in medicine in recent decades. He then details antihumanistic behaviors and policies in the current political environment and makes the case that these behaviors and policies threaten humanism in medicine. He calls on the medical profession to renew its commitment to humanism and to oppose antihumanistic behaviors and policies. It will be hard, he concludes, to have humanism in medicine if there is no humanism in the world around us.},

  abstract = {Background: A potential concern of formative testing using web-based applications ("apps") is provision of limited feedback. Adopting a randomised controlled trial in 463 first year (bio) medical students, we explored if providing immediate, detailed feedback during "app"-based formative testing can further improve study behaviour and study performance of (bio)medical students. Methods: Students had access to a formative testing "app", which involved 7 formative test modules throughout the 4-week course. In a randomised order, subjects received the "app" with (n = 231, intervention) or without (n = 232, control) detailed feedback during the formative test modules. Results: No differences in app-use was found between groups (P = 0.15), whereas the intervention group more frequently reviewed information compared to controls (P = 0.007). Exam scores differed between non-/moderate-/intensive- users of the "app" (P {$<$} 0.001). No differences in exam scores were found between intervention (6.6 ± 1.1) versus control (6.6 ± 1.1, P = 0.18). Time spent studying was significantly higher compared to previous courses in moderate- and intensive-users (P = 0.006 and {$<$} 0.001, respectively), but not in non-users (P = 0.55). Time spent studying did not differ between groups (P {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions: Providing detailed feedback did not further enhance the effect of a web-based application of formative testing on study behaviour or study performance in (bio)medical students, possibly because of a ceiling-effect.},

  abstract = {Background: Case-based learning (CBL) is a long established pedagogical method, which is defined in a number of ways depending on the discipline and type of 'case' employed. In health professional education, learning activities are commonly based on patient cases. Basic, social and clinical sciences are studied in relation to the case, are integrated with clinical presentations and conditions (including health and ill-health) and student learning is, therefore, associated with real-life situations. Although many claims are made for CBL as an effective learning and teaching method, very little evidence is quoted or generated to support these claims. We frame this review from the perspective of CBL as a type of inquiry-based learning. Aim: To explore, analyse and synthesise the evidence relating to the effectiveness of CBL as a means of achieving defined learning outcomes in health professional prequalification training programmes. Method: Selection criteria: We focused the review on CBL for prequalification health professional programmes including medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, nursing and midwifery, social care and the allied health professions (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, etc.). Papers were required to have outcome data on effectiveness. Search strategies: The search covered the period from 1965 to week 4 September 2010 and the following databases: ASSIA, CINAHL, EMBASE, Education Research, Medline and Web of Knowledge (WoK). Two members of the topic review group (TRG) independently reviewed the 173 abstracts retrieved from Medline and compared findings. As there was good agreement on inclusion, one went onto review the WoK and ASSIA EndNote databases and the other the Embase, CINAHL and Education Research databases to decide on papers to submit for coding. Coding and data analysis: The TRG modified the standard best evidence medical education coding sheet to fit our research questions and assessed each paper for quality. After a preliminary reliability exercise, each full paper was read and graded by one reviewer with the papers scoring 3-5 (of 5) for strength of findings being read by a second reviewer. A summary of each completed coding form was entered into an Excel spread sheet. The type of data in the papers was not amenable to traditional meta-analysis because of the variability in interventions, information given, student numbers (and lack of) and timings. We, therefore, adopted a narrative synthesis method to compare, contrast, synthesise and interpret the data, working within a framework of inquiry-based learning. Results: The final number of coded papers for inclusion was 104. The TRG agreed that 23 papers would be classified as of higher quality and significance (22\%). There was a wide diversity in the type, timing, number and length of exposure to cases and how cases were defined. Medicine was the most commonly included profession. Numbers of students taking part in CBL varied from below 50 to over 1000. The shortest interventions were two hours, and one case, whereas the longest was CBL through a whole year. Group sizes ranged from students working alone to over 30, with the majority between 2 and 15 students per group. The majority of studies involved single cohorts of students (61\%), with 29\% comparing multiple groups, 8\% involving different year groups and 2\% with historical controls. The outcomes evaluation was either carried out postintervention only (78 papers; 75\%), preintervention and postintervention (23 papers; 22\%) or during and postintervention (3 papers; 53\%). Our analysis provided the basis for discussion of definitions of CBL, methods used and advocated, topics and learning outcomes and whether CBL is effective based on the evaluation data. Conclusion: Overwhelmingly, students enjoy CBL and think that it enhances their learning. The empirical data taken as a whole are inconclusive as to the effects on learning compared with other types of activity. Teachers enjoy CBL, partly because it engages, and is perceived to motivate, students. CBL seems to foster learning in small groups though whether this is the case delivery or the group learning effect is unclear.},

  abstract = {The transition to the assessment of entrustable professional activities as part of competency-based medical education (CBME) has substantially increased the number of assessments completed on each trainee. Many CBME programs are having difficulty synthesizing the increased amount of assessment data. Learning analytics are a way of addressing this by systematically drawing inferences from large datasets to support trainee learning, faculty development, and program evaluation. Early work in this field has tended to emphasize the significant potential of analytics in medical education. However, concerns have been raised regarding data security, data ownership, validity, and other issues that could transform these dreams into nightmares. In this paper, the authors explore these contrasting perspectives by alternately describing utopian and dystopian futures for learning analytics within CBME. Seeing learning analytics as an important way to maximize the value of CBME assessment data for organizational development, they argue that their implementation should continue within the guidance of an ethical framework.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among variables associated with teams in team-based learning (TBL) settings and team outcomes. Methods: We administered the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Psychiatry Subject Test first to individuals and then to teams of Year three students at four medical schools that used TBL in their psychiatry core clerkships. Team cohesion was analysed using the Team Performance Scale (TPS). Bivariate correlation and linear regression analysis were used to analyse the relationships among team-level variables (mean individual TPS scores for each team, mean individual NBME scores of teams, team size, rotation and gender make-up) and team NBME test scores. A hierarchical linear model was used to test the effects of individual TPS and individual NBME test scores within each team, as well as the effects of the team-level variables of team size, team rotation and gender on team NBME test scores. Individual NBME test and TPS scores were nested within teams and treated as subsampling units. Results: Individual NBME test scores and individual TPS scores were positively and statistically significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) associated with team NBME test scores, when team rotation, team size and gender make-up were controlled for. Higher team NBME test scores were associated with teams rotating later in the year and larger teams (p {$<$} 0.01). Gender make-up was not significantly associated. Conclusions: The results of an NBME Psychiatry Subject Test administered to TBL teams at four medical schools suggest that larger teams on later rotations score higher on a team NBME test. Individual NBME test scores and team cohesion were positively and significantly associated with team NBME test scores. These results suggest the need for additional studies focusing on team outcomes, team cohesion, team size, rotation and other factors as they relate to the effective and efficient performance of TBL teams in health science education.},

It has been recognized for a long time with evidence of stone found in ∼7,000-year-old mummies and remains a common problem worldwide, indicating ineffective prevention in the past. Precise pathogenic and molecular mechanisms of kidney stone formation are still poorly understood and should be further elucidated. Also, identification of novel therapeutic targets for better therapeutic outcome and successful prevention of the occurrence and recurrence of the stone are crucially required. One of the most promising tools for current and future biomedical research is proteomics, which has been extensively and widely applied to the nephrology field during the past 5 years. Its high-throughput capability holds a great promise also to kidney stone research. This chapter provides a brief overview of proteomic methodologies recently used for the investigation of nephrolithiasis and recent proteomic studies of nephrolithiasis are summarized.

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that patients with kidney stone disease, and particularly calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, exhibit dysbiosis in their fecal and urinary microbiota compared with controls. The alterations of microbiota go far beyond the simple presence and representation of Oxalobacter formigenes, a well-known symbiont exhibiting a marked capacity of degrading dietary oxalate and stimulating oxalate secretion by the gut mucosa. Thus, alterations of the intestinal microbiota may be involved in the pathophysiology of calcium kidney stones. However, the role of nutrition in this gut-kidney axis is still unknown, even if nutritional imbalances, such as poor hydration, high salt, and animal protein intake and reduced fruit and vegetable intake, are well-known risk factors for kidney stones. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the gut-kidney axis in nephrolithiasis from a nutritional perspective, summarizing the evidence supporting the role of nutrition in the modulation of microbiota composition, and their relevance for the modulation of lithogenic risk.},

  abstract = {Importance: No clinically applicable diagnostic test exists for severe mental disorders. Lipids harbor potential as disease markers. Objective: To define a reproducible profile of lipid alterations in the blood plasma of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) independent of demographic and environmental variables and to investigate its specificity in association with other psychiatric disorders, ie, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicohort case-control diagnostic analysis involving plasma samples from psychiatric patients and control individuals collected between July 17, 2009, and May 18, 2018. Study participants were recruited as consecutive and volunteer samples at multiple inpatient and outpatient mental health hospitals in Western Europe (Germany and Austria [DE-AT]), China (CN), and Russia (RU). Individuals with DSM-IV or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnoses of SCZ, MDD, BPD, or a first psychotic episode, as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls without a mental health-related diagnosis were included in the study. Samples and data were analyzed from January 2018 to September 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma lipidome composition was assessed using liquid chromatography coupled with untargeted mass spectrometry. Results: Blood lipid levels were assessed in 980 individuals (mean [SD] age, 36 [13] years; 510 male individuals [52\%]) diagnosed with SCZ, BPD, MDD, or those with a first psychotic episode and in 572 controls (mean [SD] age, 34 [13] years; 323 male individuals [56\%]). A total of 77 lipids were found to be significantly altered between those with SCZ (n = 436) and controls (n = 478) in all 3 sample cohorts. Alterations were consistent between cohorts (CN and RU: [Pearson correlation] r = 0.75; DE-AT and CN: r = 0.78; DE-AT and RU: r = 0.82; P {$<$} 10-38). A lipid-based predictive model separated patients with SCZ from controls with high diagnostic ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86-0.95). Lipidome alterations in BPD and MDD, assessed in 184 and 256 individuals, respectively, were found to be similar to those of SCZ (BPD: r = 0.89; MDD: r = 0.92; P {$<$} 10-79). Assessment of detected alterations in individuals with a first psychotic episode, as well as patients with SCZ not receiving medication, demonstrated only limited association with medication restricted to particular lipids. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, SCZ was accompanied by a reproducible profile of plasma lipidome alterations, not associated with symptom severity, medication, and demographic and environmental variables, and largely shared with BPD and MDD. This lipid alteration signature may represent a trait marker of severe psychiatric disorders, indicating its potential to be transformed into a clinically applicable testing procedure..},

This period of graduate medical education (GME) is critical to creating a physician workforce with the specialized skills needed to care for the population. Completing GME training is also a requirement for obtaining medical licensure in all 50 states. Yet, crucial federal and state funding for GME is capped, creating a bottleneck in training an adequate physician workforce to meet future patient care needs. Thus, additional GME funding is needed to train more physicians. When considering this additional GME funding, it is imperative to take into account not only the future physician workforce but also the value added by residents to teaching hospitals and communities during their training. Residents positively affect patient care and health care delivery, providing intrinsic and often unmeasured value to patients, the hospital, the local community, the research enterprise, and undergraduate medical education. This added value is often overlooked in decisions regarding GME funding allocation. In this article, the authors underscore the value provided by residents to their training institutions and communities, with a focus on current and recent events, including the global COVID-19 pandemic and teaching hospital closures.},

While MCQs are commonly used in exams, creating them might provide another opportunity for students to boost their learning. Yet, the effectiveness of student-generated multiplechoice questions in medical education has been questioned. This study aims to verify the effects of student-generated MCQs on medical learning either in terms of students’ percep­ tions or their performance and behavior, as well as define the circumstances that would make this activity more useful to the students. Articles were identified by searching four databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and ERIC, as well as scanning references. The titles and abstracts were selected based on a pre-established eligibility criterion, and the methodolo­ gical quality of articles included was assessed using the MERSQI scoring system. Eight hundred and eighty-four papers were identified. Eleven papers were retained after abstract and title screening, and 6 articles were recovered from cross-referencing, making it 17 articles in the end. The mean MERSQI score was 10.42. Most studies showed a positive impact of developing MCQs on medical students’ learning in terms of both perception and perfor­ mance. Few articles in the literature examined the influence of student-generated MCQs on medical students learning. Amid some concerns about time and needed effort, writing multiple-choice questions as a learning method appears to be a useful process for improving medical students’ learning.},

We performed a narrative review of the publications of the NHS and NHS II between 1990 and 2016 based on biospecimens, including blood and tumor tissue, collected from participants. Results.TheNHShas contributed to the discovery of genetic loci influencingmore than 45 complex human phenotypes, including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, reproductive characteristics, and anthropometric traits. The combination of genomewide genotype data with extensive exposure and lifestyle data has enabled the evaluation of gene-environment interactions. Furthermore, data suggest that longer telomere length increases risk of cancers not related to smoking, and that modifiable factors (e.g., diet) may have an impact on telomere length. "Omics" research in the NHS continues to expand, with epigenetics and metabolomics becoming greater areas of focus. Conclusions.Thecombination ofprospectivebiomarker dataandbroadexposure information has enabled the NHS to participate in a variety of "omics" research, contributing to understanding of the epidemiology and biology of multiple complex diseases.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} Medical education is continually evolving particularly through the modern implementation of educational technology. Enhancing interactive learning in the classroom or lecture settings is one of the growing uses of educational technology. The role and potential benefits of such technology may not be as evident in developing educational systems like the one in Iraq. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect and perception of the use of an audience response system (ARS) on interactive medical education in Iraq. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research methodology approach was used to study the effects and users’ perceptions (both student and tutor) of the ARS. Method:\enspace{} The study was conducted in an Iraqi medical school in the Head and Neck course during the spring semester for third-year medical students. The course involved fifteen one-hour lectures over fifteen weeks. Users’ perceptions were evaluated by survey and focus group discussions (FGD). Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative measures and thematic analysis for the qualitative data. An ARS system was installed and integrated into the course lectures throughout the course period of three months to enhance interactive learning. Three to five interactive questions were used in each lecture. Anonymous participation and answers were maintained. The appropriate discussion was initiated when pertinent depending on students’ answers. Result:\enspace{} Most students (77\% of survey, 85\% of FGD) perceived the use of ARS as impactful on their learning. They found the ARS engaging (70\%), motivating (76\%), promoting interactions (73\%), and augment learning through better understanding and remembering (81\%). Through the FGD, students expressed improved focus, enhanced thinking and reflection, and joyful learning. The educator perceived the ARS use as practical, interactive, thinkingstimulator, and reflective of student’s understanding. The required technology skills were reasonable; however, it demanded extra non-insignificant time to learn the use. Conclusion:\enspace{} The perception of the ARS in this study was overall positive, providing encouragement for wide application of this technology in medical education in the developing world. Further studies are needed to validate and prioritize ARS usage in medical education in Iraq.},

METHODS: Students' experiences were evaluated after exposing them to the use of voting during lectures in their paediatrics course. Questions were delivered to the students taking paediatrics course. Thirty-six students out of the total of 40 (90\%) attended the opening lecture, at which the first survey concerning previous experiences of lectures was performed. Thirty-nine students (98\%) answered the second series of questions at the end of the paediatrics course. RESULTS: Most of the students felt that voting improved their activity during lectures, enhanced their learning, and that it was easier to make questions during lectures than earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The students gained new, exciting insights much more often during the paediatrics course than before. We as teachers found that voting during lectures could easily overcome some of the obstacles of good lecturing.},

  abstract = {Purpose Thirty years ago, academies were conceived as a sociocultural approach to revitalize the teaching mission of medical schools and to promote educators' career advancement. The academy movement has grown rapidly and now reaches a broad range of health professions education organizations. The authors conducted a scoping review to map the literature and describe the evidence that guides the formation of new academies and justifies the continuation of existing ones. Method The authors searched MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Elsevier and Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (via Clarivate Analytics) from inception through March 6, 2020, for publications regarding academy-like organizations. They mapped the relevant literature using logic modeling as an organizing framework and included the mission, resources, activities, output, outcomes, and impact of the included academies. Results Of the 513 publications identified, 43 met the inclusion criteria, the oldest of which was published in 2000. Most publications were either case reports or perspective/opinion pieces (26, 57.8\%), while studies presenting empirical findings were less common (11, 24.4\%). Publications showed that academies were diversifying and increasingly were part of a broad range of organizations, including departments, hospitals, health science campuses, and national organizations. The mission, resources, and activities were similar across academies. Evaluation studies were largely limited to process measures, and rigorous studies examining outcomes (i.e., changes in academy participants) and impact on the organization at large were rare. Conclusions The increase in the number of academy-related publications parallels the accelerating speed of the academy movement. To sustain this movement, rigorous studies must provide evidence that academies contribute to the revitalization of organizations' teaching mission and bring about an academic culture where educators thrive and where education is a legitimate career path.},

While there are several tools to study learning styles of students, the visual-aural-read/write-kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire is a simple, freely available, easy to administer tool that encourages students to describe their behavior in a manner they can identify with and accept. The aim is to understand the preferred sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students, 83\%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire. Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study had multiple learning preferences (68.7\%). The predominant sensory modality of learning was aural (45.5\%) and kinesthetic (33.1\%). The learning style preference was not influenced by either sex or previous academic performance. Although we use a combination of teaching methods, there has not been an active effort to determine whether these adequately address the different types of learners. We hope these data will help us better our course contents and make learning a more fruitful experience.},

  abstract = {Background: Blended learning, which combines face-to-face learning and e-learning, has grown rapidly to be commonly used in education. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this learning approach has not been completely quantitatively synthesized and evaluated using knowledge outcomes in health education. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of blended learning compared to that of traditional learning in health education. Methods: We performed a systematic review of blended learning in health education in MEDLINE from January 1990 to July 2019. We independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and compared overall blended learning versus traditional learning, offline blended learning versus traditional learning, online blended learning versus traditional learning, digital blended learning versus traditional learning, computer-aided instruction blended learning versus traditional learning, and virtual patient blended learning versus traditional learning. All pooled analyses were based on random-effect models, and the I2statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity across studies. Results: A total of 56 studies (N=9943 participants) assessing several types of learning support in blended learning met our inclusion criteria; 3 studies investigated offline support, 7 studies investigated digital support, 34 studies investigated online support, 8 studies investigated computer-assisted instruction support, and 5 studies used virtual patient support for blended learning. The pooled analysis comparing all blended learning to traditional learning showed significantly better knowledge outcomes for blended learning (standardized mean difference 1.07, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.28, I2=94.3\%). Similar results were observed for online (standardized mean difference 0.73, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.86, I2=94.9\%), computer-assisted instruction (standardized mean difference 1.13, 95\% CI 0.47 to 1.79, I2=78.0\%), and virtual patient (standardized mean difference 0.62, 95\% CI 0.18 to 1.06, I2=78.4\%) learning support, but results for offline learning support (standardized mean difference 0.08, 95\% CI-0.63 to 0.79, I2=87.9\%) and digital learning support (standardized mean difference 0.04, 95\% CI-0.45 to 0.52, I2=93.4\%) were not significant. Conclusions: From this review, blended learning demonstrated consistently better effects on knowledge outcomes when compared with traditional learning in health education. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore the utility of different design variants of blended learning.},

To gain more insight into the family-level dynamics involved in autonomy-supportive parenting, the present study addressed three issues. First, on the basis of self-determination theory, we examined whether mothers’ satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness related to autonomy-supportive parenting. Second, we investigated maternal autonomy support as an intervening variable in the mother–child similarity in psychological need satisfaction. Third, we examined associations between autonomy-supportive parenting and autonomy-supportive sibling interactions. Participants were 154 mothers ( M age = 39.45, SD = 3.96) and their two elementary school-age children ( M age = 8.54, SD = 0.89 and M age = 10.38, SD = 0.87). Although mothers’ psychological need satisfaction related only to maternal autonomy support in the younger siblings, autonomy-supportive parenting related to psychological need satisfaction in both siblings and to an autonomy-supportive interaction style between siblings. We discuss the importance of maternal autonomy support for family-level dynamics.},

A compelling and concise abstract can convince peer reviewers, conference selection committee members, and conference attendees that the research described therein is worthy for inclusion in the conference program and/or for their attendance in the meeting. This AMEE Guide is designed to help medical educators write research conference abstracts that can achieve these outcomes. To do so, this Guide begins by examining the rhetorical context (i.e. the purpose, audience, and structure) of research conference abstracts and then moves on to describe the abstract selection processes common to many medical education conferences. Next, the Guide provides theory-based information and concrete suggestions on how to write persuasively. Finally, the Guide offers some writing tips and some proofreading techniques that all authors can use. By attending to the aspects of the research conference abstract addressed in this Guide, we hope to help medical educators enhance this important text in their writing repertoire.},

This approach has been successfully adopted by a number of medical educators. This strategy allowed us to eliminate anatomy lectures and incorporate small-group active learning. Although our strategy is a modified use of classical TBL, in the text, we use the standard terminology of TBL for simplicity. We have modified classical TBL to fit our curricular needs and approach. Anatomy lectures were replaced with TBL activities that required pre-class reading of assigned materials, an individual self-assessment quiz, discussion of learning issues derived from the reading assignments, and then the group retaking the same quiz for discussion and deeper learning. Students' performances and their educational experiences in the TBL format were compared with the traditional lecture approach. We offer several in-house unit exams and a final comprehensive subject exam provided by the National Board of Medical Examiners. The students performed better in all exams following the TBL approach compared to traditional lecture-based teaching. Students acknowledged that TBL encouraged them to study regularly, allowed them to actively teach and learn from peers, and this served to improve their own exam performances. We found that a TBL approach in teaching anatomy allowed us to create an active learning environment that helped to improve students' performances. Based on our experience, other preclinical courses are now piloting TBL. © 2007 American Association of Anatomists.},

Extra-curricular, research-related activities are a key method by which students develop interest in their field of choice, and a competitive edge in medical students. The lack of research education and opportunities within medical school teaching tends to force medical students to look beyond their degree to obtain this experience, and is often the reason why students have little research involvement whilst in medical school. Self-reflecting on one’s personality and suitability for different types of research is vital, as well as understanding the nature of research and preparing appropriately before undertaking projects. This paper presents twelve tips for medical students who are interested in pursuing research, offering targeted strategies to get involved.},

Method: The authors searched five online databases for articles published on spaced learning in health professions education prior to February 2018. Two researchers independently screened articles for eligibility with set inclusion criteria. They extracted and analysed key data using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: Of the 2972 records retrieved, 120 articles were included in the review. More than 90\% of these articles were published in the last 10~years. The definition of spaced learning varied widely and was often not theoretically grounded. Spaced learning was applied in distinct contexts, including online learning, simulation training and classroom settings. There was a large variety of spacing formats, ranging from dispersion of information or practice on a single day, to intervals lasting several months. Generally, spaced learning was implemented in practice or testing phases and rarely during teaching. Conclusions: Spaced learning is infrequently and poorly defined in the health professions education literature. We propose a comprehensive definition of spaced learning and emphasise that detailed descriptions of spacing formats are needed in future research to facilitate the operationalisation of spaced learning research and practice in health professions education.},

Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low-SDOs in Study 1, and for high-SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge.},

  abstract = {Background: Most medical students lack confidence and are unable to accurately interpret ECGs. Thus, better methods of ECG instruction are being sought. Current literature indicates that the use of e-learning for ECG analysis and interpretation skills (ECG competence) is not superior to lecture-based teaching. We aimed to assess whether blended learning (lectures supplemented with the use of a web application) resulted in better acquisition and retention of ECG competence in medical students, compared to conventional teaching (lectures alone). Methods: Two cohorts of fourth-year medical students were studied prospectively. The conventional teaching cohort (n = 67) attended 4 hours of interactive lectures, covering the basic principles of Electrocardiography, waveform abnormalities and arrhythmias. In addition to attending the same lectures, the blended learning cohort (n = 64) used a web application that facilitated deliberate practice of systematic ECG analysis and interpretation, with immediate feedback. All participants completed three tests: pre-intervention (assessing baseline ECG competence at start of clinical clerkship), immediate post-intervention (assessing acquisition of ECG competence at end of six-week clinical clerkship) and delayed post-intervention (assessing retention of ECG competence 6 months after clinical clerkship, without any further ECG training). Diagnostic accuracy and uncertainty were assessed in each test. Results: The pre-intervention test scores were similar for blended learning and conventional teaching cohorts (mean 31.02 ± 13.19\% versus 31.23 ± 11.52\% respectively, p = 0.917). While all students demonstrated meaningful improvement in ECG competence after teaching, blended learning was associated with significantly better scores, compared to conventional teaching, in immediate (75.27 ± 16.22\% vs 50.27 ± 17.10\%, p {$<$} 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.58), and delayed post-intervention tests (57.70 ± 18.54\% vs 37.63 ± 16.35\%, p {$<$} 0.001; Cohen’s d = 1.25). Although diagnostic uncertainty decreased after ECG training in both cohorts, blended learning was associated with better confidence in ECG analysis and interpretation. Conclusion: Blended learning achieved significantly better levels of ECG competence and confidence amongst medical students than conventional ECG teaching did. Although medical students underwent significant attrition of ECG competence without ongoing training, blended learning also resulted in better retention of ECG competence than conventional teaching. Web applications encouraging a stepwise approach to ECG analysis and enabling deliberate practice with feedback may, therefore, be a useful adjunct to lectures for teaching Electrocardiography.},

Such shifts are well known to occur within graduate medical education (GME). However, TL in GME has yet to be formally explored. Objective We performed a scoping review of the literature on TL within GME to identify areas where trainees currently experience or have potential to experience TL, and to explore areas where fostering TL has been used as a pedagogical tool. Methods In January 2020, we searched 7 databases to identify literature on TL in GME. Additional articles were identified by handsearching the Journal of Graduate Medical Education. Results A total of 956 articles were identified through database search with 3 unique articles found via hand-searching. Abstracts and manuscripts were screened by 2 authors and disagreements arbitrated by a third, yielding 28 articles for our analysis. The main components of TL (disorienting dilemma, reflection, discourse, action) took various forms. TL was closely linked with professionalism training and professional identity formation. Training programs in primary care fields were most frequently referenced. Often, trainees were experiencing TL without recognition of the theory by their educators. Gaps in the graduate medical education literature exist pertaining to TL in venues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion. Conclusions Our scoping review uncovered the following themes: TL and professionalism, TL and primary care, and TL by other names. TL is likely occurring but going unrecognized in some settings.},

  abstract = {Background: The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the UK regulatory authority, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of 4–12 weeks. The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. Methods: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials—one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)—and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5 × 1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2 × 1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). Findings: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17 178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7\% (95\% CI 57·4–74·0), with 84 (1·0\%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9\%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9\%) of 12 282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1\%) of 11 962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0\% (59·3–85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95\% CI 0·59–0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3\% [95\% CI 60·3–91·2] at ≥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1\% [33·0–69·9] at {$<$}6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18–55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01–2·68]). Interpretation: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

Results well-known in that field imply that GHZ states can be transformed into W states at rate 1 for any number of parties. As a generalization, we find that the asymptotic conversion rate from GHZ states to Dicke states is bounded as the number of subsystems increases and the number of excitations is fixed. By generalizing constructions of Coppersmith and Winograd and by using monotones introduced by Strassen, we also compute the conversion rate from W to GHZ states.},

Analysis of in-depth interviews held with each student show four over-arching themes shared by the participants. First, students showed significant self-insight into how they perceive themselves competing. This occurred on both the cognitive and affective domains. Second, with relative consistency, students reported avoiding competitive situations where they did not believe chances were good that they would win. Conversely, they tended to involve themselves in situations where success was perceived as possible or likely. Third, gender differences existed in how the students viewed competition. And fourth, we found that classroom competition affected how the students related to one another on personal levels.}

  abstract = {Kahoot! is a game-based learning platform used to review students' knowledge, for formative assessment or as a break from traditional classroom activities. It is among the most popular game-based learning platforms, with 70 million monthly active unique users and used by 50\% of US K-12 students. Since the platform was released in 2013, many studies have been published on the effect of using Kahoot! in the classroom, but so far, no systematic analysis of the results. This article presents the results of a literature review on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning and, more specifically, on how Kahoot! affects learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes and perceptions, and students' anxiety. The literature review includes 93 studies, and the main conclusion is that Kahoot! can have a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attitudes, and students’ anxiety. However, there are also studies where Kahoot! has little or no effect. The main challenges mentioned by students include technical problems such as unreliable internet connections, hard to read questions and answers on a projected screen, not being able to change answer after submission, stressful time-pressure for giving answers, not enough time to answer, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up if an incorrect answer had been given. Further, the main challenges mentioned by teachers include getting the difficulty level of questions and answers right, problems related to network connectivity, scoring based on how quickly the students answer reducing student reflection and cause some students to guess without thinking, that some students can have a problem with failing a quiz, and some teachers find it challenging to use the technology.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of portable digital devices, especially smartphones, learning a new language has become a popular trend in the age of globalization. Amongst mobile-assistant language-learning applications, Duolingo is widely used and employs persuasive design techniques to inspire and encourage users to acquire new linguistic skills. Several papers have been studied based on this application by exploring pedagogical issues and discussing the misuse of gamification design. From a holistic perspective, limited research exists on how Duolingo's persuasive design motivates and engages language learners. The study utilized a walkthrough and a focus group alongside semi-structured interviews with 11 Duolingo users to investigate how persuasive design elements are employed to engage users. The findings of this study suggest that the gamification design in Duolingo is enjoyable and enhances users’ motivation; streaks make users commit to their learning plan; rewards encourage users to learn constantly; notifications play a significant role as triggers for learning behavior to occur; notifications also remind users to return to the application after a suspension. Moreover, it is important to design notifications with both the attitude and content in mind, as they have the power to affect user experience.},

We investigated whether metabolite profiles could predict the development of diabetes. Among 2,422 normoglycemic individuals followed for 12 years, 201 developed diabetes. Amino acids, amines and other polar metabolites were profiled in baseline specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile). The results were replicated in an independent, prospective cohort. These findings underscore the potential key role of amino acid metabolism early in the pathogenesis of diabetes and suggest that amino acid profiles could aid in diabetes risk assessment. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

  abstract = {Urolithiasis is a common urological disease with a high morbidity and recurrence rate, of which calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most common type of stone that underlies the disease. However, the potential metabolic mechanisms of CaOx urolithiasis remain unclear. The present study aimed to seek potential biomarkers and metabolic mechanisms of CaOx urolithiasis in adults. Urine samples were collected from 36 healthy individuals and 36 patients diagnosed with bilateral upper-urinary-tract stones. All of the stones were composed of CaOx. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to perform a metabolic fingerprinting analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares determinant analysis (OPLS-DA) were carried out to analyze the multivariate data. There were 18 differential metabolites identified, which mainly involved caffeine, phenylalanine, galactose, and tyrosine metabolism. The results revealed potential urinary biomarkers, via metabolic fingerprinting of adults with CaOx urolithiasis, which may help to improve future metabolic evaluation of urolithiasis. The elucidated metabolic pathways may have potential applications as novel treatment targets of CaOx urolithiasis. Additionally, our study suggests that the UPLC-Q-TOF/MS platform may offer new insights into the pathobiology of urolithiasis.},

We named this new method Surgery Simulation Teaching based on a Real Reconstruction Aid (RRA-SST). A prospective randomized comparison was performed with the traditional surgical live teaching method to evaluate the training effectiveness of RRA-SST for adult DDH-THA. Methods: Twenty-six trainees, who were already practicing but were not experienced, participated in the study. We randomly divided the trainees into two groups: Group A (n = 13) received RRA-SST and group B (n = 13) received traditional surgical live teaching. A surgery simulation test and a questionnaire were used for evaluation. Next, each group received training with the other teaching method, and then the test and questionnaire were used again for evaluation. Results: After the first test, the RRA-SST method was shown to produce better results than the traditional surgical live teaching method. After the second test, the results showed the training effect in both groups reached the same level, which was level as Group A RRA-SST results. Analysis of the questionnaire results showed that the training effect of RRA-SST was higher than that of traditional surgical live teaching, from multiple perspectives. Conclusions: The use of RRA-SST improved participant performance according to simulation assessment. RRA-SST can be helpful for trainees who are already practicing but not experienced when developing proficiency in adult DDH-THA surgical techniques.},

Identifying the factors that influence active online learning in a smart learning environment is critical for proposing targeted improvement strategies and enhancing their active online learning effec-tiveness. This study constructs the research framework of active online learning with theories of learning satisfaction, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and a smart learning environment. We hypothesize that the following factors will influence active online learning: Typical characteristics of a smart learning environment, perceived usefulness and ease of use, social isolation, learning expectations, and complaints. A total of 528 valid questionnaires were collected through online platforms. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis using SmartPLS 3 found that: (1) The personalization, intelligent interaction, and real-time feedback of the smart learning environment all have a positive impact on active online learning; (2) the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in the technology acceptance model (TAM) positively affect active online learning; (3) innovatively discovered some new variables that affect active online learning: Learning expectations positively impact active online learning, while learning complaints and social isolation negatively affect active online learning. Based on the results, this study proposes the online smart teaching model and discusses how to promote active online learning in a smart environment.},

  abstract = {Background Diagnostic errors are prevalent and associated with increased economic burden; however, little is known about their characteristics at the national level in Japan. This study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes and indemnity payment in cases of diagnostic errors using Japan's largest database of national claims. Methods We analyzed characteristics of diagnostic error cases closed between 1961 and 2017, accessed through the national Japanese malpractice claims database. We compared diagnostic error-related claims (DERC) with non-diagnostic error-related claims (non-DERC) in terms of indemnity, clinical outcomes, and factors underlying physicians' diagnostic errors. Results All 1,802 malpractice claims were included in the analysis. The median patient age was 33 years (interquartile range = 10-54), and 54.2\% were men. Deaths were the most common outcome of claims (939/1747; 53.8\%). In total, 709 (39.3\%, 95\% CI: 37.0\%-41.6\%) DERC cases were observed. The adjusted total billing amount, acceptance rate, adjusted median claims payments, and proportion of deaths were significantly higher in DERC than non- DERC cases. Departments of internal medicine and surgery were 1.42 and 1.55 times more likely, respectively, to have DERC cases than others. Claims involving the emergency room (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.88) and outpatient office (adjusted OR = 2.87) were more likely to be DERC than other cases. The initial diagnoses most likely to lead to diagnostic error were upper respiratory tract infection, non-bleeding digestive tract disease, and "no abnormality."Conclusions Cases of diagnostic errors produced severe patient outcomes and were associated with high indemnity. These cases were frequently noted in general exam and emergency rooms as well as internal medicine and surgery departments and were initially considered to be common, mild diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing hormone secreted by adipocytes. Levels of adiponectin are inversely associated with adiposity and insulin resistance. Because both adiposity and insulin resistance have been associated with risk of colorectal cancer, we hypothesized that adiponectin is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. Methods: We evaluated the association between adiponect in and colorectal cancer among 18 225 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who provided blood samples in 1994. Between blood collection and January 31, 2002, 179 incident colorectal cancer cases occurred. Each case patient was matched to two control subjects on year of birth and date of blood draw. Information on lifestyle factors and diet was collected using biennial questionnaires and food frequency questionnaires. Logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We observed a statistically significant inverse association between plasma adiponectin levels and risk of colorectal cancer (for the highest quintile [Q5] versus the lowest quintile [Q1], RR = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.78; Ptrend = .01). The association was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for body mass index (Q5 versus Q1, RR = 0.48, 95\% CI = 0.25 to 0.90; Ptrend = .04) or for body mass index and other major risk factors for colorectal cancer (family history, physical activity, multivitamin use, smoking, alcohol, aspirin use, history of endoscopy, dietary calcium, folate, vitamin E, and vitamin D; Q5 versus Q1, multivariable RR = 0.50, 95\% CI = 0.26 to 0.97; Ptrend = .08). Relative risks were not linear in any of the analyses; the second quintile had a lower relative risk than the lowest quintile, but further decreases in risk were not evident with increasing levels of adiponectin. Conclusions: In this prospective nested case-control study, men with low plasma adiponectin levels had a higher risk of colorectal cancer than men with higher levels. More prospective observational studies, particularly in women, and mechanistic studies are required to fully understand the relationship between adiponectin and carcinogenesis. © The Author 2005.

  abstract = {Background: Interprofessional collaboration is increasingly important in healthcare, but interprofessional education (IPE) faces challenges, such as different study programmes with varied schedules and campuses. These challenges can be met, in part, by using web-based virtual patients (VPs) as a tool in IPE. However, demands for relevant patient presentations and clinical practice increase when VPs are used by students from different programmes. The aim of this study was to improve the presentation of professional perspectives regarding nurses and physicians and their collaboration in order to increase the clinical authenticity of existing VPs. Methods: Clinical observations were conducted to gain familiarity with the context. Semi-structured interviews were performed with individual nurses and physicians with experience of patients with leg ulcers. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The clinical observations exposed a lack of interprofessional collaboration in practice with regard to patients with leg ulcers. The interview analysis resulted in two themes: Clinical care and Organizational structure. The theme Clinical care included nursing with a holistic approach to the patient and awareness of the patient’s well-being, including nutrition and home situation. The theme Organizational structure revealed a lack of teamwork in primary care. The interviewees stressed learning together and sharing responsibility, and they emphasised the importance of implementing interprofessional learning in the education of nurses and physicians in order to stimulate future teamwork. The VP should offer a broad medical history so that healthcare students are made aware of how a disease can affect the patient’s social situation, and thereby illustrate the importance of interprofessional collaboration. The information should also be comprehensive and clear, leading to a diagnosis, so the student can gain clinical knowledge and build a foundation for discussion of treatment. Conclusions: Interviews and observations in clinical practice can be used to enhance authenticity in VPs for interprofessional learning. A thorough look at authentic clinical environments can enrich and improve educational settings using VPs, and it can highlight the challenges students can encounter in clinical care of the patient and in an organisation with regard to interprofessional collaboration.},

  abstract = {Context: Recent decades have seen the international implementation of programmes aimed at assuring the continuing competence of doctors. Maintenance of Professional Competence (MPC) programmes aim to encourage doctors' lifelong learning and ensure high-quality, safe patient care; however, programme requirements can be perceived as bureaucratic and irrelevant to practice, leading to disengagement. Doctors' attitudes and beliefs about MPC are critical to translating regulatory requirements into committed and effective lifelong learning. We aimed to summarise knowledge about doctors' attitudes to MPC to inform the development of MPC programmes and identify under-researched areas. Methods: We undertook a scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley, including sources of evidence about doctors' attitudes to MPC in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) as a guide. Results: One hundred and twenty-five sources of evidence were included in the review. One hundred and two were peer-reviewed publications, and 23 were reports. Most were from the United Kingdom or the United States and used quantitative or mixed methods. There was agreement across jurisdictions that MPC is a good idea in theory but doubt that it achieves its objectives in practice. Attitudes to the processes of MPC, and their impact on learning and practice were mixed. The lack of connection between MPC and practice was a recurrent theme. Barriers to participation were lack of time and resources, complexity of the requirements and a lack of flexibility in addressing doctors' personal and professional circumstances. Conclusions: Overall, the picture that emerged is that doctors are supportive of the concept of MPC but have mixed views on its processes. We highlight implications for research and practice arising from these findings.},

  abstract = {Although it has long been recognized that the enteric community of bacteria that inhabit the human distal intestinal track broadly impacts human health, the biochemical details that underlie these effects remain largely undefined. Here, we report a broad MS-based metabolomics study that demonstrates a surprisingly large effect of the gut "microbiome" on mammalian blood metabolites. Plasma extracts from germ-free mice were compared with samples from conventional (conv) animals by using various MS-based methods. Hundreds of features were detected in only 1 sample set, with the majority of these being unique to the conv animals, whereas ≈10\% of all features observed in both sample sets showed significant changes in their relative signal intensity. Amino acid metabolites were particularly affected. For example, the bacterial-mediated production of bioactive indole-containing metabolites derived from tryptophan such as indoxyl sulfate and the antioxidant indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) was impacted. Production of IPA was shown to be completely dependent on the presence of gut microflora and could be established by colonization with the bacterium Clostridium sporogenes. Multiple organic acids containing phenyl groups were also greatly increased in the presence of gut microbes. A broad, drug-like phase II metabolic response of the host to metabolites generated by the microbiome was observed, suggesting that the gut microflora has a direct impact on the drug metabolism capacity of the host. Together, these results suggest a significant interplay between bacterial and mammalian metabolism. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

However, transplant monitoring still depends on relatively dated technologies - serum creatinine levels, urine output, and histopathology of biopsy samples. These techniques do not offer sufficient specificity, sensitivity, or accuracy for appropriate and timely interventions. As a result, more specific diagnostic techniques, based on proteomics, genomics and metabolomics are being sought. Metabolomics (the high-throughput measurement and analysis of metabolites) may make it possible to monitor transplants more effectively and specifically. Changes in the concentration profiles of a number of small molecule metabolites found in either blood or urine can be used to localize kidney damage, assess organs at risk of rejection, assess kidneys suffering from ischemiareperfusion injury or identify organs that have been damaged by immunosuppressive drugs. The application of metabolomics to kidney transplant monitoring is still in its early stages. Nevertheless, there are a number of easily measured metabolites in both urine and serum that can provide reliable indications of kidney function, kidney injury, and immunosuppressive drug toxicity. Metabolomics could serve as a good complement to existing proteomic and genomic technologies. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.},

The rapid growth in metabolomics is leading to a renewed interest in metabolism and the role that small molecule metabolites play in many biological processes. As a result, traditional views of metabolites as being simply the “bricks and mortar” of cells or just the fuel for cellular energetics are being upended. Indeed, metabolites appear to have much more varied and far more important roles as signaling molecules, immune modulators, endogenous toxins, and environmental sensors. This review explores how metabolomics is yielding important new insights into a number of important biological and physiological processes. In particular, a major focus is on illustrating how metabolomics and discoveries made through metabolomics are improving our understanding of both normal physiology and the pathophysiology of many diseases. These discoveries are yielding new insights into how metabolites influence organ function, immune function, nutrient sensing, and gut physiology. Collectively, this work is leading to a much more unified and system-wide perspective of biology wherein metabolites, proteins, and genes are understood to interact synergistically to modify the actions and functions of organelles, organs, and organisms.},

We identify 27 genetic loci, of which 22 have not previously been reported for glycine. We show that glycine is genetically associated with lower CHD risk and find that this may be partly driven by blood pressure. Evidence for a genetic association of glycine with T2D is weaker, but we find a strong inverse genetic effect of hyperinsulinaemia on glycine. Our findings strengthen evidence for a protective effect of glycine on CHD and show that the glycine-T2D association may be driven by a glycine-lowering effect of insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {Background: Test-enhanced learning has gained popularity because it is an effective way to increase retention of knowledge; provided the student receives the correct answer soon after the test is taken. Aim: To determine whether detailed feedback provided to test-enhanced learning questions is an effective online educational tool for improving performance on complex biomedical information exams. Methods: A series of online multiple choice tests were developed to test knowledge of biomedical information that students were expected to know after each patient-case. Following submission of the student answers, one cohort (n=52) received answers only while the following year, a second cohort (n=51) received the answers with detailed feedback explaining why each answer was correct or incorrect. Results: Students in both groups progressed through the series of online tests with little assessor intervention. Students receiving the answers along with the explanations within their feedback performed significantly better in the final biomedical information exam than those students receiving correct answers only. Conclusions: This pilot study found that the detailed feedback to test-enhanced learning questions is an important online learning tool. The increase in student performance in the complex biomedical information exam in this study suggests that detailed feedback should be investigated not only for increasing knowledge, but also be investigated for its effect on retention and application of knowledge. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Growth mindset is a motivation theory proposed by Carol Dweck that posits our beliefs about intelligence, and the ability to change mindsets can have impacts on how we approach challenges, respond to criticism challenges and orient our goals. This study characterised articles on growth mindset theory in health professions education to: summarise the aspects of growth mindset being researched, describe the discussed benefits of growth mindset theory and outline strategies discussed that may promote a growth mindset. Methods: A systematic review of the literature yielded 4927 articles—articles were reviewed and excluded if they were outside of health professions education and did not discuss Dweck's growth mindset theory. The final review yielded 14 research articles and 13 commentaries, which were characterised and analysed using content analysis. Results: The included articles were published in 2016 and beyond; the articles represented a diverse context, participant type and approach. Most research studies measured participant mindsets and evaluated the correlation with other variables (eg grit, well-being, anxiety). Articles often highlighted benefits and strategies to promote a growth mindset at the learner, educator and organisation level. The most common learner benefits were to help them be more receptive to feedback as well as increased resiliency and perseverance, educator benefits focused on supporting collaborative relationships and safe learning environments. The most prevalent strategies discussed were teaching learners about growth mindset theory, shifting faculty feedback to emphasise effort and to prioritise feedback across the organisation. Conclusion: The growth mindset framework has been shown in other fields to help others manage educational challenges and enhance learning environments. Researchers are encouraged to explore how interventions such as teaching about and prioritising a growth mindset can support learners, health care professionals, educators and organisations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The learner-centred approach in medical and health sciences education makes the study of learning preferences relevant and important. This study aimed to investigate the interdisciplinary, inter-institutional, gender and racial differences in the preferred learning styles among Malaysian medical and health sciences students in three Malaysian universities, namely SEGi University (SEGi), University of Malaya (UM) and Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). It also investigated the differences in the preferred learning styles of these students between high achievers and non-high achievers. METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out on medical and health sciences students from three Malaysian universities following the approval of the Research and Ethics Committee, SEGi University. Purposive sampling was used and the preferred learning styles were assessed using the VARK questionnaire. The questionnaire was validated prior to its use. Three disciplines (medicine, pharmacy and dentistry) were chosen based on their entry criteria and some similarities in their course structure. The three participating universities were Malaysian universities with a home-grown undergraduate entry medical program and students from a diverse cultural and socioeconomic background. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 22. VARK subscale scores were expressed as mean+standard deviation. Comparisons of the means were carried out using t-test or ANOVA. A p value of {$<$}0.05 was considered as statistically significant, and {$<$}0.001 as highly significant. RESULTS Both statistically significant interdisciplinary and inter-institutional differences in learning preferences were observed. Out of the 337 students, a majority of the participants were unimodal learners (n=263, 78.04\%). The most common type of learners was the reading/writing type (n=92, 27.30\%) while the kinesthetic subscale (M=6.98, SD=2.85) had the highest mean score. Female students (M=6.86, SD=2.86) scored significantly higher than male students (M=6.08, SD=2.41; t(249), p=0.014) in the auditory subscale, whereas Chinese students (M=5.87, SD=2.65) scored significantly higher than Malay students (M=4.70, SD=2.87; p=0.04) in the visual subscale. However, the mean VARK subscale scores did not differ significantly between high achievers and non-high achievers (p{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSION This study gives an insight into the learner characteristics of more than one medical school in Malaysia. Such multi-institutional studies are lacking in the published literature and this study gives a better representation of the current situation in the learning preferences among medical students in Malaysia.},

  abstract = {Background: Bedside teaching (BT) is a valuable learning experience for medical students. In 2010, the BT curriculum at the University of Dundee was revised so that clinical specialist doctors facilitated these sessions. The aim of this study was to compare student opinion of BT delivered by specialist and non-specialist doctors. Methods: A retrospective survey was sent to two medical student year groups who received teaching delivered by either specialist or non-specialist doctors during year 2. Results: The response rate was 24.5 per cent, of which 49.4 per cent were taught by specialists. Responses indicated that specialist doctors improved communication skills (p = 0.034), were less intimidating (p = 0.01) and gave greater opportunity to ask questions (p = 0.028) than their non-specialist counterparts. Overall, students taught by specialty doctors rated BT as more valuable (p {$<$} 0.001). A positive correlation was noted between the frequency of patient interaction and the overall value of BT (p {$<$} 0.0121); however, there was no significant association between the main teaching location and the overall value of BT. Discussion: Findings indicate that specialist doctors provide students with a better understanding of disease processes. Several students from the specialist group noted that their tutors linked theory to practice. No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding whether teaching was at an appropriate level. Specialist doctors therefore allow a number of improvements over the use of non-specialist doctors for BT.},

Objective: To outline some major mechanisms involved in formation of medical students' professional identity. Methods: A qualitative study based on thematic analysis. 296 diary entries, written by eight medical students as part of the three-year course 'Becoming a Physician,' were reviewed. The course, conducted in small groups, gradually exposes students to the clinical field, and emphasizes awareness to marginalized populations, and interpersonal communication skills. Results: Following the social constructivist learning theory, where learners individually and socially construct meaning attributed to their experiences, we identified three major mechanisms based on students' written reflections. These include linking current experiences to past; comparing different types or aspects of knowledge, doctors or medicine; and future perspective taking. Conclusions: This study sheds light on the possible mechanisms used by medical students in forming their professional identity prior to their clinical training. Knowing these mechanisms can help medical educators better understand and support their students in formation of their professional identities. Conducting reflective writing could serve as an effective tool for learners to comprehend the meanings of their experiences.},

Methods: We conducted a scoping review, registered with BEME, by comprehensively searching health science databases and related grey literature from January 2008 to January 2021 for studies involving longitudinal GME curricula aimed to train future clinician-educators. Results: From 9437 articles, 36 unique curricula were included in our review. Most curricula were designed for residents (n = 26) but were heterogeneous in structure, instructional methods, and content. Several curricular themes emerged, including: 1) duration ≥ 12 months, 2) application of theory-based didactics with experiential activities, 3) independent projects, 4) exposure to faculty mentorship and educator communities, 5) strengthening competencies beyond teaching and scholarship, and 6) protected time and funding. Most outcomes were positive and focused on learner satisfaction or behavior change related to scholarly output and career tracking. Conclusions: Curricula in our review included important skills including experiential teaching, scholarly projects, and exposure to educator communities. Future curricula should build on these competencies and include more assessment of learner and program outcomes.},

Methods The mixed methods used in this research included a narrative literature review, a critical review of theory and qualitative empirical analysis, conducted within a process of cooperative inquiry. Results Kirkpatrick's levels, introduced to evaluate training in industry, involve so many implicit assumptions that they are suitable for use only in relatively simple instructional designs, short-term endpoints and beneficiaries other than learners. Such conditions are met by perhaps one-fifth of medical education evidence reviews. Under other conditions, the hierarchical application of the levels as a critical appraisal tool adds little value and leaves reviewers to make global judgements of the trustworthiness of the data. Conclusions Far from defining a reference standard critical appraisal tool, this research shows that 'quality' is defined as much by the purpose to which evidence is to be put as by any invariant and objectively measurable quality. Pending further research, we offer a simple way of deciding how to appraise the quality of medical education research. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2012.},

Three key assumptions underpin the Guide: learning is 'situated'; it can be viewed either as an individual or a collective process; and the learning relevant to this Guide is triggered by authentic practice-based experiences. We first provide an overview of the guiding principles of experiential learning and significant historical contributions to its development as a theoretical perspective. We then discuss socio-cultural perspectives on experiential learning, highlighting their key tenets and drawing together common threads between theories. The second part of the Guide provides examples of learning from experience in practice to show how theoretical stances apply to clinical workplaces. Early experience, student clerkships and residency training are discussed in turn.

We believe that this effectiveness is directly related to a sound understanding of the theory, supporting the learning. The purpose of this article is to introduce readers to the theories underpinning experiential learning, which are then expanded further in an AMEE Guide, which considers the theoretical basis of experiential learning from a social learning, constructionist perspective and applies it to three stages of medical education: early workplace experience, clerkships and residency. This article argues for the importance and relevance of experiential learning and addresses questions that are commonly asked about it. First, we answer the questions 'what is experiential learning?' and 'how does it relate to social learning theory?' to orientate readers to the principles on which our arguments are based. Then, we consider why those ideas (theories) are relevant to educators ranging from those with responsibilities for curriculum design to 'hands-on' teachers and workplace supervisors. The remainder of this article discusses how experiential learning theories and a socio-cultural perspective can be applied in practice. We hope that this will give readers a taste for our more detailed AMEE Guide and the further reading recommended at the end of it. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Epidemiological studies have shown the association of urolithiasis with a number of lifestyle-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying urinary stone formation will enable development of new preventive treatments. The present article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology and potential treatment of urolithiasis. Recent literature has shown that oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species could be one such mechanistic pathway. Calcium oxalate crystals adhering to renal tubular cells are incorporated into the cells through the involvement of osteopontin. Stimulation of crystal–cell adhesion impairs acceleration of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in tubular cells, resulting in mitochondrial collapse, oxidative stress and activation of the apoptotic pathway in the initial steps of renal calcium crystallization. With regard to genetic factors, studies show that single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding calcium-sensing receptor, vitamin D receptor and osteopontin are correlated with urolithiasis. Genome-wide association studies have shown that CLDN14 and NPT2 are associated with urolithiasis in Caucasian and Japanese populations, respectively. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis would aid in the prediction of urolithiasis risk and recurrence. New diagnostic methods and preventive approaches, along with complete removal of stones, will improve the management of urolithiasis.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Self-Assessment (SA) is often assumed to be essential for learning, however, this assumption has been extensively rebutted. Research shows SA has significant limitations, including its lack of correlation with competence. Method: We undertook a scoping review of SA in medical education (2011–2021) and surprisingly discovered substantial research where SA was erroneously assumed to be a valid measure of successful learning, or a skill needing to be taught. Although the initial intent of our scoping review was to explore where SA is being effectively used to advance lifelong learning, we paused to explore the extent of the problem of its misuse and resulting in wasted research, by examining excluded studies. Results: From 1151 articles, we identified 207 which ignored the documented limitations of SA. Thirty-nine studies explored SA of learning. This research has limited utility: increasing the accuracy of SA does not improve performance or lifelong learning. One hundred and sixty-eight used SA as an outcome measure to assess a program or intervention, including 63 where self-assessed improvement in knowledge/skills was the sole measure. SA of self-confidence was measured in 62 studies. When confidence was compared with an objective measure of performance, both invariably increased, but confidence did not always align with competence when measured. Discussion: Many researchers mistakenly assume the ability to accurately self-assess is essential for learning, so focus on teaching self-calibration rather than evidence-based methods of advancing learning. Other researchers incorrectly suppose that self-reported improvements in knowledge/skills provide evidence of the efficacy of a program/intervention. This is particularly troubling with regards to novices, who may believe that because they self-assess to have improved/gained confidence, they are now competent. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the significant volume of research being done where SA is misunderstood and/or misused as a measurement. We posit reasons that such research continues to take place and suggest solutions moving forward.},

  abstract = {Purpose: These authors sought to define the new roles and competencies required of administrative staff and faculty in the age of CBME. Method: A modified Delphi process was used to define the new CBME roles and competencies needed by faculty and administrative staff. We invited international experts in CBME (volunteers from the ICBME Collaborative email list), as well as faculty members and trainees identified via social media to help us determine the new competencies required of faculty and administrative staff in the CBME era. Results: Thirteen new roles were identified. The faculty-specific roles were: National Leader/Facilitator in CBME; Institutional/University lead for CBME; Assessment Process \& Systems Designer; Local CBME Leads; CBME-specific Faculty Developers or Trainers; Competence Committee Chair; Competence Committee Faculty Member; Faculty Academic Coach/Advisor or Support Person; Frontline Assessor; Frontline Coach. The staff-specific roles were: Information Technology Lead; CBME Analytics/Data Support; Competence Committee Administrative Assistant. Conclusions: The authors present a new set of faculty and staff roles that are relevant to the CBME context. While some of these new roles may be incorporated into existing roles, it may be prudent to examine how best to ensure that all of them are supported within all CBME contexts in some manner.},

  abstract = {Background: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly affected education, with most universities changing face-to-face classes to online formats. To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, we adopted a blended learning approach to anatomy instruction that included online lectures, pre-recorded laboratory dissection videos, and 3D anatomy applications, with condensed offline cadaver dissection. Methods: We aimed to examine the learning outcomes of a newly adopted anatomy educational approach by 1) comparing academic achievement between the blended learning group (the 2020 class, 108 students) and the traditional classroom learning group (the 2019 class, 104 students), and 2) an online questionnaire survey on student preference on the learning method and reasons of preference. Results: The average anatomy examination scores of the 2020 class, who took online lectures and blended dissection laboratories, were significantly higher than those of the 2019 class, who participated in an offline lecture and dissection laboratories. The questionnaire survey revealed that students preferred online lectures over traditional large group lecture-based teaching because it allowed them to acquire increased self-study time, study according to their individual learning styles, and repeatedly review lecture videos. Conclusion: This study suggests that a blended learning approach is an effective method for anatomy learning, and the advantage may result from increased self-directed study through online learning.},

  abstract = {The idea of students as authors of assessment items, in particular, multiple-choice questions, is being increasingly taken up by classroom teachers, and studies examining its educational po­ tential have largely been positive. A concomitant question regarding if and how students benefit from the use of student-authored questions with answers and explanations for learning is currently understudied. Noting that the structures, types, and amount of knowledge between a teacher and students may be distinctly different, the purpose of this study was to examine whether there are different learning effects from the use of student- versus teacher-generated explanations for answers to online multiple-choice questions. Additionally, an attempt was made to determine the ways that explanations generated by students and teachers differ. A nonequivalent pretest-posttest experimental research design was adopted. Four sixth-grade classes (n = 104) from a single primary school participated in six weekly online multiple-choice questionanswering exercises. Although the results of the analysis of covariance did not show statistically significant between-group differences in academic achievement, the participants receiving student-generated explanations had significantly better attitudes toward the subject matter as compared to their counterparts receiving teacher-generated explanations. A content analysis on the explanations generated by the teacher and students, followed up by chi-square tests of in­ dependence, post-hoc pairwise tests with Bonferroni correction, and t-tests further revealed sig­ nificant differences in several areas, including types of explanations, styles, and number of words.},

  abstract = {Background Mentorship plays an essential role in enhancing the success of junior faculty. Previous evaluation tools focused on specific types of mentors or mentees. The main objective was to develop and provide validity evidence for a Mentor Evaluation Tool (MET) to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one mentoring for faculty in the academic health sciences. Methods Evidence was collected for the validity domains of content, internal structure and relationship to other variables. The 13 item MET was tested for internal structure evidence with 185 junior faculty from Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Finally, the MET was studied for additional validity evidence by prospectively enrolling mentees of three different groups of faculty (faculty nominated for, or winners of, a lifetime achievement in mentoring award; faculty graduates of a mentor training program; and faculty mentors not in either of the other two groups) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and asking them to rate their mentors using the MET. Mentors and mentees were clinicians, educators and/or researchers. Results The 13 MET items mapped well to the five mentoring domains and six competencies described in the literature. The standardized Cronbach’s coefficient alpha was 0.96. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a single factor (CFI = 0.89, SRMR = 0.05). The three mentor groups did not differ in the single overall assessment item (P = 0.054) or mean MET score (P = 0.288), before or after adjusting for years of mentoring. The mentorship score means were relatively high for all three groups. Conclusions The Mentor Evaluation Tool demonstrates evidence of validity for research, clinical, educational or career mentors in academic health science careers. However, MET did not distinguish individuals nominated as outstanding mentors from other mentors. MET validity evidence can be studied further with mentor-mentee pairs and to follow prospectively the rating of mentors before and after a mentorship training program.},

  abstract = {Grey relational analysis (GRA) is a part of the Grey system theory (GST). It is appropriate for solving problems with complicated interrelationships between multiple factors/parameters and variables. It solves multiple-criteria decision-making problems by combining the entire range of performance attribute values being considered for every alternative into one single value. Thus, the main problem is reduced to a single-objective decision-making problem. In this study, we developed a decision support system for the evaluation of written exams with the help of GRA using contextual text mining techniques. The answers obtained from the written exam with the participation of 50 students in a computer laboratory and the answer key prepared by the instructor constituted the data set of the study. A symmetrical perspective allows us to perform relational analysis between the students’ answers and the instructor’s answer key in order to contribute to the measurement and evaluation. Text mining methods and GRA were applied to the data set through the decision support system employing the SQL Server database management system, C\#, and Java programming languages. According to the results, we demonstrated that the exam papers are successfully ranked and graded based on the word similarities in the answer key.}

However, the pathogenesis of gout is still uncertain, and novel biomarkers are needed for early prediction and diagnosis of gout. The aim of this study was to develop a systemic metabolic profile of patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (HUA) and gout by using a metabolomics approach, and find potential pathophysiological mechanisms of and markers of predisposition to gout. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 149 subjects, including 50 patients with HUA, 49 patients with gout and 50 healthy controls. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis were used to distinguish between samples from patients and healthy controls. Clinical measurements and pathway analysis were also performed to contribute to understanding of the metabolic change. Results: By serum metabolic profiling, 21 metabolites including lipids and amino acids were significantly altered in patients with HUA or gout. The levels of identified biomarkers together with clinical data showed apparent alteration trends in patients with HUA or gout compared to healthy individuals. According to pathway analysis, three and five metabolic pathways were remarkably perturbed in patients with HUA or gout, respectively. These enriched pathways involve in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acids metabolism and energy metabolism. Conclusions: Taken together, we identified the biomarker signature for HUA and gout, which provides biochemical insights into the metabolic alteration, and identified a continuous progressive axis of development from HUA to gout.},

  abstract = {Nephrolithiasis is highly prevalent across all demographic groups in the Western world and beyond, and its incidence rates are rising. In addition to the morbidity of the acute event, stone disease often becomes a lifelong problem that requires preventative therapy to diminish ongoing morbidity. Across the majority of stone types, increased fluid intake and targeted dietary modifications are mainstays of therapy. Specific dietary interventions associated with reduced calcium stone risk include adequate dietary calcium intake and restriction of sodium, protein, and oxalate intake, among others. Pharmaceutical therapy may be required if lifestyle changes are insufficient to minimize risk of stone recurrence, and must be targeted to the specific metabolic abnormalities portending risk for a given patient. Therapeutic options for idiopathic calcium stone disease include thiazides, citrate salts, and uric acid–lowering agents. Alkali salts are also the treatment of choice for uric acid stone disease. Management of struvite stone disease is largely surgical, but acetohydroxamic acid is a proven second line therapy. Cystinuria requires lifestyle modifications and may call for thiol-binding agents. Significant heterogeneity of the clinical population with stone disease has previously limited opportunities for large randomized controlled trials. However, as clinical phenotypes and genotypes are increasingly clarified, there are mounting opportunities for targeted randomized controlled trials in stone prevention. In the meantime, the currently available evidence for both lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions is reviewed herein.},
