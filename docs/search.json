This is a massive achievement for our department, and we couldn’t be prouder.\n\nOur Lab has synthesized the most elements of them all.\n— Prof. Herzog\n\nThe Sixtus Award is a prestigious recognition given to institutions that have demonstrated exceptional performance in chemical research. The award is named after the renowned chemist Sixtus Leung, who made significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry.\nThis achievement is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and passion of our faculty, students, and staff. Our department has consistently produced groundbreaking research that has contributed to the advancement of the field of chemistry, and we’re honored to receive this recognition.\nThe award will be presented to our department in a formal ceremony that will take place on May 15th, 2023. We encourage all members of our department to join us in celebrating this achievement.\n\n\nElizabeth Lee, a leading researcher in the field of biochemistry, spoke about her recent work on the development of new cancer treatments using small molecule inhibitors, and the lecture was very well-attended by both students and faculty.\nIn case you missed it, there’s a recording on EDGARP\n\n\n\nNext Tuesday, there will be a Lab Safety Training.\nThese trainings are crucial for ensuring that all members of the department are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to work safely in the laboratory. Attendance is mandatory.\n\n\n\nAliquam sit amet lectus ut libero congue viverra. Morbi quis diam ullamcorper, iaculis ex non, fermentum mauris. Aliquam consectetur vitae purus vitae laoreet.
